The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

All\\nthe cells available in each mixing evaluation planes\\ncontribute for the calculations. This method is more\\naccurate if the gap between two planes is reduced and\\nthe numbers of evaluation planes are increased.\\nTable 3 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

This message indicates that when a script or command was executed via bash, it attempted to invoke the 'docker' command, but the system could not find it in the current environment. This is a typical command-not-found error related to missing or improperly installed software, or PATH issues.\n\nNext, I need to determine if this explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality. In the context of OpenFOAM, a dimensional inequality usually appears as an error comparing two quantities’ dimensions, such as:\n\n- \"Dimension mismatch: [dim1] != [dim2]\"\n- \"Incompatible dimensions\"\n- Explicit comparison like \"[0 0 0 -1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 -2 0 0 0]\"\n\nThese errors explicitly mention \"dimension\" or \"dimensions\" and involve comparing numerical dimension vectors or labels indicating units.\n\nIn the given error message, there is no mention of dimensions, units, or any kind of comparison involving physical quantities. It solely states that the 'docker' command was not found in the bash environment. This is a command execution problem, not a physical or mathematical inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the error does not explicitly reference a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: no",

Then, I will adapt the key parameters—such as application, startFrom, startTime, stopAt, endTime, deltaT, writeControl, writeInterval, writeFormat, writePrecision, runTimeModifiable, adjustTimeStep, maxCo, nCorrectors, nNonOrthogonalCorrectors, pRefCell, pRefValue—based on typical or specified requirements. I will preserve the formatting style and units/dimensions where applicable.
