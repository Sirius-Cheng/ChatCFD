The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

All\\nthe cells available in each mixing evaluation planes\\ncontribute for the calculations. This method is more\\naccurate if the gap between two planes is reduced and\\nthe numbers of evaluation planes are increased.\\nTable 3 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12.

Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe error message indicates a fatal IO error in OpenFOAM, specifically while reading the header for the object `controlDict` located in the `system` directory. The key lines are:\n\n```\n--> FOAM FATAL IO ERROR: (openfoam-2406 patch=241212)\nproblem while reading header for object controlDict\n\nfile: system/controlDict at line 1.\n```\n\nThis suggests that OpenFOAM encountered an issue when trying to read or interpret the `controlDict` file at startup. The error occurs at line 1 of that file, which is often where the file begins, possibly indicating a syntax error, a corrupted file, or an incompatible format.\n\nAdditionally, the traceback points to a function involved in reading files:\n\n```\nFrom virtual Foam::autoPtr<Foam::ISstream> Foam::fileOperations::uncollatedFileOperation::readStream(...)\nin file global/fileOperations/uncollatedFileOperation/uncollatedFileOperation.C at line 650.\n```\n\nThis confirms that the problem is related to file reading, likely due to issues with the `controlDict` file.\n\nNow, regarding whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality: \n\n- Dimensional inequalities in OpenFOAM typically appear as dimension mismatch errors during calculations or checks within the solver or boundary conditions, often explicitly stating the mismatch of units or dimensions, e.g., `[0 0 0 1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 2 0 0 0]`.\n- These errors usually occur during the solution process or when reading input fields, not during the initial parsing of configuration files like `controlDict`.\n- The current error is about failing to read the header of `controlDict`, which is a setup/configuration file, not a field or a property that involves units or dimensions explicitly.\n\nGiven this, the error appears to be related to file reading/parsing issues rather than a dimensional mismatch. It does not explicitly reference or suggest a problem with incompatible dimensions or dimension inequalities.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nThe error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nno",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nThe error message indicates a problem while reading the header for the object controlDict in the file system/controlDict at line 1. The specific error is a FOAM FATAL IO ERROR, which typically suggests that the file might be missing, corrupted, or unreadable. The message does not contain the phrase cannot find file, which means the error is not explicitly stating that the file is missing. It points to a problem with reading or parsing the file, possibly due to format issues or corruption. Given the instructions, I need to check for the phrase cannot find file. Since it is not present in this message, the appropriate response is no.\n\nHere is my response:  \nno",

The message also references an internal function involved in reading files, indicating a problem during the parsing process.\n\nThe key clues are:  \n- The error is a \"FATAL IO ERROR\" during the reading of the `fvSchemes` file header.  \n- It occurs at line 2 of `system/fvSchemes`.  \n- The problem is likely related to the file's format or contents, possibly a syntax error or corruption.\n\nImportantly, the error message does not mention anything about dimensions, units, or mismatched physical dimensions. It does not reference any dimension lists, incompatible dimensions, or patterns typical of dimensional analysis errors.\n\nGiven the context, this is most likely a syntax or formatting problem within the `fvSchemes` file rather than a dimensional mismatch. If it were a dimensional inconsistency, the message would explicitly mention dimensions, such as `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] != [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]` or similar references.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that this error is unrelated to dimensional inequalities.\n\nHere is my response:  \nno",

The `fvSchemes` file is a key configuration file in OpenFOAM that defines the discretization schemes used for different terms in the solver equations.\n\nThe error occurs during the reading process, which suggests possible issues such as:\n\n- The file `system/fvSchemes` being missing, corrupted, or improperly formatted.\n- An error in the syntax of the `fvSchemes` file, especially near line 2.\n- A mismatch or inconsistency in expected data types or structure in the header section.\n\nThe mention of \"problem while reading header\" at line 2 is particularly telling. Typically, the first lines in `fvSchemes` include comments and the `FoamFile` header, followed by the actual schemes definitions. If the header is malformed or missing, OpenFOAM may fail to parse the file correctly.\n\nSince the error explicitly points to an IO problem while reading the header, it does **not** directly indicate a dimensional mismatch or inequality, which usually manifests as errors during field definitions or boundary conditions with explicit dimension checks.\n\n**Therefore, this error is related to file I/O and syntax issues, not explicitly to dimensional inequalities.**\n\n---\n\n**Here is my response:**\n\nThe OpenFOAM runtime error indicates that there was a fatal input/output problem encountered when trying to read the header of the `fvSchemes` file. Specifically, the error message points to an issue at line 2 of `system/fvSchemes`, which typically suggests a problem with the file's format, syntax, or content at the very beginning.\n\nCommon causes for this error include:\n\n- The `fvSchemes` file being missing, corrupted, or improperly formatted.\n- Syntax errors near the top of the file, such as incorrect `FoamFile` headers or misplaced brackets.\n- The file not starting with the expected structure, leading to a failure during parsing.\n\nThis problem generally does **not** indicate a dimensional inequality or mismatch. Instead, it suggests that OpenFOAM cannot properly read or interpret the file due to formatting issues or corruption.\n\n**Recommendations to resolve this issue:**\n\n1. Check if the `system/fvSchemes` file exists and is accessible.\n2. Open the `fvSchemes` file and verify its syntax, especially around line 2. Ensure it starts with a proper `FoamFile` header, such as:\n\n```plaintext\nFoamFile\n{\n    version     2.0;\n    format      ascii;\n    class       dictionary;\n    object      fvSchemes;\n}\n```\n\n3. Confirm that the syntax and brackets are correctly placed and that there are no missing or extra characters.\n4. If the file appears corrupted or improperly formatted, restore it from a backup or regenerate it using the appropriate utility.\n5. Ensure no extra or hidden characters (like BOM) are present that might interfere with parsing.\n\nBy correcting the syntax and ensuring the file's integrity, you should be able to resolve this I/O error.",

The problem occurred at line 2 of this file, which suggests that there might be an issue right at the beginning of the configuration file.\n\nThe error occurs during the reading process, specifically while reading the header for the object `fvSolution`. The header information in OpenFOAM dictionaries includes the object type and possibly some metadata. If this header is malformed, missing, or incompatible with expected syntax or structure, OpenFOAM can produce such an error.\n\nThe mention of:\n\n```\nFrom virtual Foam::autoPtr<Foam::ISstream> Foam::fileOperations::uncollatedFileOperation::readStream(...) in file global/fileOperations/uncollatedFileOperation/uncollatedFileOperation.C at line 650.\n```\n\nindicates that the error occurred during stream reading, which further points to an issue with the format or content of the `fvSolution` file.\n\nRegarding the specific question about whether the error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality: \n\n- The error message does not mention any dimensions, units, or any inequality related to physical dimensions.\n- It is about reading the header of a configuration object, not about mismatched units or dimensions.\n- There are no keywords such as \"dimensions,\" \"incompatible dimensions,\" or explicit dimension lists showing inequality.\n\nTherefore, this error seems unrelated to dimensional inequalities or mismatched units. It appears more to be a syntax or formatting problem in the `fvSolution` file, such as a malformed header, missing braces, or incorrect syntax.\n\nHere is my response:\n\n**no**",

Specifically, it states:\n\n```\nunexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\n    while reading object thermophysicalProperties\nfile: constant/thermophysicalProperties at line 14.\n```\n\nThis suggests that OpenFOAM was expecting the `thermophysicalProperties` file to contain a dictionary structure, but instead, it encountered a class name or a different structure that didn't match the expected format.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, the `thermophysicalProperties` file should define a dictionary that includes all necessary thermophysical properties for the simulation, such as mixture models, transport models, and chemical compositions. The top-level structure typically begins with:\n\n```\nthermophysicalProperties\n{\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nIf, at line 14, the parser encountered something that it didn't recognize as part of a dictionary, such as a class name or a misplaced keyword, it would throw this error.\n\nPossible causes for this issue include:\n\n1. **Incorrect file syntax or formatting:**  \n   - Missing braces `{}`  \n   - Incorrect indentation or misplaced lines  \n   - Wrong keywords or class names instead of dictionary entries\n\n2. **Corrupted or improperly generated file:**  \n   - Manually edited file with syntax errors  \n   - Incorrect template or placeholder text left in the file\n\n3. **Incorrect class name or version mismatch:**  \n   - Using a custom or incompatible version of the `thermophysicalProperties` file that does not conform to the expected format\n\n4. **Line 14 specifics:**  \n   - Since the error references line 14, examine that line for anomalies: is it starting a new dictionary, is it a keyword, or a class name?  \n   - Ensure that line 14 is part of the dictionary and not an extraneous class name or incorrect entry.\n\nThis error **does not** explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality. It is about the structure and syntax of the input file, not about incompatible units or dimensions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The error is not directly about dimensional inequality.\n- It is about the syntax and structure of the `thermophysicalProperties` input file.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n**no**",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe error message indicates a fatal input/output (IO) error during the execution of OpenFOAM. Specifically, it points to an unexpected class name 'thermophysicalProperties' that was expected to be a dictionary. The relevant part of the message is:\n\n\"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\"\n\nand it occurs while reading the object 'thermophysicalProperties' in the file located at \"constant/thermophysicalProperties\" at line 7.\n\nThis suggests that the syntax or structure of the 'thermophysicalProperties' file is invalid. OpenFOAM expects this file to define a dictionary with key-value pairs that specify thermophysical properties (e.g., mixture properties, transport models, etc.). Instead, it appears that the parser encountered the class name 'thermophysicalProperties' in a context where it was expecting a dictionary, which indicates a likely syntax error or misconfiguration.\n\nThis kind of error is common if, for example:\n\n- The 'constant/thermophysicalProperties' file starts with a class declaration like 'thermophysicalProperties' instead of opening a dictionary with '{'.\n\n- The file is malformed or incomplete, missing the opening '{' or other necessary syntax.\n\n- There is a typo or incorrect indentation that causes the parser to misinterpret the structure.\n\n- The file is not properly formatted as per OpenFOAM's syntax, which requires a specific dictionary structure.\n\nThis error does **not** explicitly mention a dimensional inequality or compare dimensions. It is about the structure of the input file and the class expected at a certain point in parsing, not about incompatible units or dimensional mismatches.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the provided error message, this is a syntax or structure issue rather than a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: \n\nno",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe error message indicates a fatal input/output (IO) error in OpenFOAM, specifically related to the file `constant/thermophysicalProperties`. The key parts are:\n\n- \"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\"  \n- \"while reading object thermophysicalProperties\"  \n- The error occurs at line 7 of the `thermophysicalProperties` file.\n\nThis suggests that OpenFOAM was expecting a dictionary (a set of key-value pairs enclosed in braces `{}`), but instead encountered a class name, which likely means the syntax or structure of the `thermophysicalProperties` file is incorrect.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, the `thermophysicalProperties` file should be a dictionary defining various properties like `mixture`, `transportModel`, `thermoType`, and so forth, each with their own sub-dictionaries and key-value pairs.\n\nPossible causes for this error include:\n\n- The `thermophysicalProperties` file is missing braces or has incorrect formatting.\n- The first line might be a class name or an object declaration that is not expected at that position.\n- There might be a syntax error such as a missing `{` or `}`.\n- The file could be incomplete or corrupted.\n\nThis error does **not** explicitly relate to dimensional inequalities or mismatched units/dimensions. It is primarily about the expected data structure (dictionary) not being correctly formatted or recognized.\n\nNow, considering the instruction to determine if the error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality:\n\n- The message does not mention dimensions, units, or any mismatch of physical dimensions.\n- It focuses on the class name and dictionary structure.\n- No keywords such as \"dimension mismatch\" or \"incompatible dimensions\" appear.\n\nTherefore, based on the details provided, this is unrelated to dimensional inequalities.\n\nHere is my response:  \n**no**",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe error message from OpenFOAM indicates a fatal I/O error related to the 'thermophysicalProperties' file. Specifically, it states:\n\n\"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\"  \nand it occurs while reading the object 'thermophysicalProperties' at line 7 in the file.\n\nThis suggests that OpenFOAM was expecting a dictionary (i.e., a set of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces) that defines thermophysical properties, but instead, it encountered a class name or a different data structure that it couldn't interpret as a dictionary.\n\nThe critical points here are:\n- The error explicitly states \"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary.\"\n- The problem occurs at line 7 of the 'constant/thermophysicalProperties' file.\n- The error is about the format and structure of the file, not about dimensions or physical units.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, the 'thermophysicalProperties' file typically looks like this:\n\n```\nthermophysicalProperties\n{\n    version     1;\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nor, in some cases, it may be:\n\n```\nthermophysicalProperties\n{\n    // properties here\n}\n```\n\nThe key point is that after the object name 'thermophysicalProperties', there must be an opening brace '{' to define a dictionary. If there is a syntax error, such as missing braces, incorrect indentation, or invalid content, OpenFOAM may interpret the entry incorrectly, leading to this error.\n\nGiven the error, it most likely indicates a syntax problem in the 'constant/thermophysicalProperties' file—probably at line 7, such as:\n\n- Missing or misplaced braces\n- Wrong indentation or formatting\n- An incorrect class name or keyword instead of a proper dictionary entry\n\nThis error does not explicitly relate to dimensional inequalities, which involve comparisons between dimensions (e.g., length units, time units) and typically would mention \"dimension mismatch\" or similar. Since the message explicitly states an unexpected class name and expects a dictionary, it points to a formatting or syntax issue.\n\nHere is my response:\n\n**The error indicates that the 'thermophysicalProperties' file in your case is improperly formatted. Specifically, OpenFOAM expected a dictionary structure after the 'thermophysicalProperties' keyword but encountered an unexpected class name or an incorrect format instead. This is most likely due to a syntax error in your 'constant/thermophysicalProperties' file, such as missing or misplaced braces, incorrect indentation, or invalid entries at or near line 7. To resolve this, review the file starting at line 7 to ensure it follows the correct syntax: it should begin with the object name followed by an opening brace '{', contain key-value pairs defining physical properties, and close with a brace '}'. Correcting the formatting and structure should fix the error.**\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n\nno",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe provided error message is a \"FOAM FATAL IO ERROR\" indicating an issue with reading the `thermophysicalProperties` file. The core problem is that the parser expects a dictionary but encounters an unexpected class name. The specific message \"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\" suggests that the format of the `thermophysicalProperties` file is incorrect—likely it is not properly formatted as a dictionary or has a syntax issue.\n\nThe message points to line 7 in the `constant/thermophysicalProperties` file. This suggests that at or near line 7, the file does not contain the correct structure, possibly missing an opening brace `{` or having an incorrect keyword that is incompatible with the expected dictionary format.\n\nIt is important to note that this error is about the structure and format of the input file in OpenFOAM, specifically about the expected data type being a dictionary. It does not explicitly mention or reference any dimensional inequalities, unit mismatches, or dimension mismatch issues.\n\nGiven the explicit mention of an \"unexpected class name\" and \"expected dictionary,\" the error pertains to the format of the input file rather than any dimensional inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, this error does not directly indicate a dimensional inequality or a mismatch in physical dimensions.\n\nHere is my response: **no**",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nThe error message indicates that there is a problem with reading the `thermophysicalProperties` dictionary in the `constant` directory. Specifically, it states:  \n`unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary` and points to line 7 of the `constant/thermophysicalProperties` file. The message suggests that OpenFOAM was expecting a dictionary (a structured set of key-value pairs within braces `{}`), but instead encountered something else, possibly an incorrect class name or syntax issue.  \n\nThe part about \"unexpected class name\" hints that the content at line 7 does not conform to the expected OpenFOAM dictionary format. Typically, the `thermophysicalProperties` file should start with a line like:  \n```plaintext\nthermoType\n{ ... }\n```  \nor similar, depending on the version and the thermophysical model used.  \n\nThe error does not explicitly mention any dimension mismatch, incompatible dimensions, or dimension inequality. Instead, it indicates a problem with the structure or class name expected in the dictionary.  \n\nTo determine whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, I look for clues in the error message:  \n- There is no mention of dimensions or mismatched units.  \n- The message clearly states an unexpected class name and an expected dictionary, which relates to syntax or structure, not dimensions.  \n\nBased on this, the error appears to be about the format or content of the `thermophysicalProperties` file, not about dimension mismatch or inequality.  \n\n**Therefore, the answer is:** no.  \n\n---\n\n**Here is my response:**  \nNo. The error message indicates an issue with the structure or content of the `thermophysicalProperties` file, specifically expecting a dictionary but encountering an unexpected class name.

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe error message indicates a \"FOAM FATAL IO ERROR\" related to the file `constant/thermophysicalProperties`. The specific message states: \n\n\"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary while reading object thermophysicalProperties.\" \n\nThis means that OpenFOAM was expecting the content of `thermophysicalProperties` to be a dictionary (which is a structured set of key-value pairs in its dictionary format), but instead, it encountered something else—most likely a different class name or an incorrect format. \n\nThe line in the file where the error occurs is line 7, which suggests that the problem is near the beginning of the file, possibly the first few lines where the object is defined. The key point here is that the parser expects a dictionary but finds something else.\n\nThis error does **not** explicitly mention anything about dimensions, units, or dimensional inequalities. Instead, it points towards a syntax or formatting issue within the `thermophysicalProperties` dictionary file. Typical causes for such errors include:\n\n- The file does not start with a proper `thermophysicalProperties` dictionary declaration.\n- The class name specified at the top of the file is incorrect or missing.\n- The syntax of the file is invalid (e.g., missing braces, incorrect indentation, or misformatted entries).\n- The file content is corrupted or not in the expected format.\n\nGiven that the error explicitly states \"unexpected class name\" and \"expected dictionary,\" it is more about the file's structure rather than a mismatch in physical dimensions or units.\n\nTherefore, the pattern here is about file syntax and format rather than dimensional inequalities.\n\nHere is my response:  \n**no**",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe error message indicates a fatal I/O error in OpenFOAM, specifically a class name mismatch during the reading of the 'thermophysicalProperties' dictionary. The key part of the message is:\n\n\"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\"\n\nThis suggests that OpenFOAM was expecting a dictionary object at the specified location but encountered a class name instead, which points to a formatting or syntax issue in the input file. The error occurs in the file `constant/thermophysicalProperties` at line 7.\n\nAdditionally, the message states:\n> while reading object thermophysicalProperties\n\nwhich indicates that during the parsing process, OpenFOAM encountered an unexpected token or object type.\n\nNow, considering the question about whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality:\n\n- The error is about an \"unexpected class name\" and \"expected dictionary,\" which refers to a syntax or formatting issue rather than a direct dimensional mismatch.\n- There are no references to dimensions, dimensional comparisons, or mismatched units in the error message.\n- The message does not mention incompatible dimensions, dimension lists, or any pattern related to dimension inequalities.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided error message, this is not an explicit indication of a dimensional inequality. It is more about the structure or syntax of the input file, specifically the `thermophysicalProperties` file, which seems to be malformed or incorrectly formatted at line 7.\n\nHere is my response:  \n**no**",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nThe error message indicates a \"FOAM FATAL IO ERROR\" related to reading the \"thermophysicalProperties\" dictionary in the file located at \"constant/thermophysicalProperties\". The key part of the message is \"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\". This suggests that when OpenFOAM is trying to parse the file, it encounters a class name where it expects a dictionary structure, but instead, it finds \"thermophysicalProperties\" at a position where a dictionary should be.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, the \"thermophysicalProperties\" file is expected to be a dictionary (a set of key-value pairs enclosed in braces). The error explicitly states \"expected dictionary\", implying that the structure of the file may be incorrect or that the syntax doesn't conform to what OpenFOAM expects.\n\nThe mention of \"line 7\" indicates that the problem occurs at or near the beginning of the file. Common issues include:  \n- The file not starting with a proper dictionary declaration (e.g., missing the opening brace '{' or having incorrect syntax)  \n- The presence of an unexpected keyword or class name where a dictionary is expected  \n- A malformed or incomplete dictionary structure  \n\nThis error does not reference any dimension or unit mismatch explicitly. It is about the structure of the input file rather than physical dimensions or units. The error does not mention incompatible dimensions, mismatched units, or explicit dimension lists. It is purely about parsing the file structure as a dictionary.\n\nTherefore, based on the pattern recognition, this is not an error about dimensional inequality. It is about an incorrect or unexpected class name in a dictionary structure within the input file.\n\nHere is my response:  \nno",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nThe error message indicates a \"FOAM FATAL IO ERROR\" related to an \"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\" while reading the object \"thermophysicalProperties\" in the file \"constant/thermophysicalProperties\" at line 7. This suggests that OpenFOAM was expecting a dictionary (which is the typical format for property files) but encountered a different class name or a malformed entry.  \n\nThe key phrase here is \"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties,\" which implies that the content in that file does not conform to the expected syntax or structure. It might mean that the file starts with a class name that is not recognized, or that the structure is not a valid dictionary.  \n\nThe question asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, which would typically involve comparisons of units or dimensions that do not match, such as mismatched length, time, or mass units. Usually, errors related to dimensional inequalities include specific mentions of dimension mismatches, such as \"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\" vs \"[1 0 0 0 0 0 0]\" or similar.  \n\nIn this error, the message points to a syntax or formatting issue with the \"thermophysicalProperties\" input file, not a dimension mismatch. There is no mention of dimensions, units, or incompatible dimensions. It clearly states an issue with the class name and the expected dictionary, which relates to file structure and syntax, not to dimensional analysis.  \n\nTherefore, based on the provided error message, the error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.  \n\nHere is my response:  \nno",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe provided error message is a fatal I/O error from OpenFOAM, indicating that there is an unexpected class name \"thermophysicalProperties\" where a dictionary was expected. The specific line points to line 7 in the file `constant/thermophysicalProperties`. The error occurs during the reading of the object `thermophysicalProperties`. \n\nThis suggests that the format or structure of the `thermophysicalProperties` file is incorrect or malformed. In OpenFOAM, such files are typically dictionaries with key-value pairs defining the thermophysical properties of the fluid, such as temperature, viscosity, etc. The error indicates that at line 7, instead of a dictionary, the parser encountered something else, possibly a class name or an unrecognized token.\n\nThe message \"(openfoam-2406 patch=241212)\" suggests a specific version or patch level, which might be relevant for compatibility or known issues.\n\nCrucially, this error does **not** directly reference any dimension mismatch, incompatible dimensions, or explicit dimensional inequality. It is about the syntax or structure of the input file, not about the comparison or mismatch of physical dimensions.\n\nThe instructions specify to look for patterns such as imbalanced dimension comparisons, keywords related to dimensions, or explicit dimension lists indicating inequality. Since the error message is about an unexpected class name and expected dictionary, and there is no mention of dimensions, dimension lists, or inequality comparisons, it is unrelated to dimensional inequalities.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, this error does not indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: **no**",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe provided error message originates from OpenFOAM and indicates a fatal input/output (IO) error related to the thermophysical properties setup. The key part of the message is:\n\n\"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\" and \"while reading object thermophysicalProperties\".\n\nThis suggests that in the file `constant/thermophysicalProperties`, OpenFOAM is expecting a dictionary (a structured set of key-value pairs defining properties), but instead, it has encountered something else—possibly a class name or some other incorrect syntax or structure.\n\nIn OpenFOAM's case, the `thermophysicalProperties` file must be correctly formatted as a dictionary, starting with an opening brace `{` and ending with a closing brace `}`. Within this dictionary, there should be entries like `transportModel`, `thermoType`, `properties`, etc. If the file has a syntax error, such as missing braces, incorrect indentation, or misplaced entries, OpenFOAM will fail to parse it correctly.\n\nThe specific mention of \"unexpected class name\" suggests that perhaps the file contains an entry that is not formatted as a dictionary but perhaps as a class or other data type, or there's a syntax mistake such as a missing brace or an incorrect line.\n\nThe line number indicated is line 7, which implies that the error is near or at that line. Checking that line for correct syntax—especially ensuring it starts with a `{` and contains well-formed key-value pairs—is crucial.\n\nFurthermore, note that this error is about a parsing or formatting issue in the input file, not about dimensional analysis or mismatched units. Therefore, it does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The error indicates a syntax or formatting problem in `constant/thermophysicalProperties`.\n- It expects a dictionary but encountered something else, possibly an incorrect class name or syntax.\n- No explicit mention of dimensional mismatch or inequality.\n\n---\n\n**Here is my response:**\n\nno",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\nThe error message indicates a fatal input/output error in OpenFOAM during runtime, specifically related to the file \"constant/thermophysicalProperties\" at line 7. The key part of the message states: \"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary.\" This suggests that OpenFOAM was expecting to read a dictionary structure at this point but encountered a different class name or an incorrect format. The error is rooted in how the file \"thermophysicalProperties\" is formatted or structured, rather than in a dimensional mismatch.\n\nThe message also points to the line in the file where the problem occurred, which can be very helpful. Typically, in OpenFOAM, \"thermophysicalProperties\" files are structured as dictionaries with specific keywords and entries that define thermophysical models, properties, and parameters. If the file contains an incorrect class name or is improperly formatted, OpenFOAM will throw this error.\n\nThe question asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, which would involve mismatched units or incompatible dimensions in the physical property definitions. Common patterns for dimensional inequality errors include messages explicitly stating that dimensions do not match, or showing mismatched dimension vectors (e.g., [0 0 0 1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 2 0 0 0]).\n\nIn this case, the error message does not mention dimensions, units, or any mismatch of dimensions. Instead, it indicates an unexpected class name and expects a dictionary, which points towards a formatting or syntax issue rather than a dimensional incompatibility.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided error message, this does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: no",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nThe error message indicates a problem with the file `constant/thermophysicalProperties`. Specifically, it states that an \"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\" was encountered while reading the object. This suggests that OpenFOAM was expecting a dictionary (a key-value structured entry) but instead found something else, possibly a class name or an incorrect format. The error occurs at line 7 of the file, implying that the issue originates early in the file, potentially from the initial entries or formatting.\n\nThe part of the message \"unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties\" hints that the file content might be incorrectly formatted or that the file begins with an entry that does not conform to expected syntax. In OpenFOAM, `thermophysicalProperties` is typically defined as a dictionary enclosed in curly braces, with specific keys such as `mixture`, `transport`, `thermo`, etc.\n\nCommon causes for such an error include:  \n- The `thermophysicalProperties` file not starting with a dictionary (i.e., missing the opening `{`)  \n- An incorrect indentation or syntax mistake  \n- Misnamed classes or entries in the file  \n- An incorrect file format (e.g., accidentally using a class definition or wrong structure)\n\nThis error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality. It is more about syntax or structure mismatch in the `thermophysicalProperties` file rather than comparing dimensions or units. Therefore, it is unlikely to be directly related to dimensional inequality patterns such as mismatched units or dimensions.\n\nHere is my response:  \nno",

The typical structure begins with:\n\n```\nthermophysicalProperties\n{\n    ... // properties\n}\n```\n\nThe error suggests that at line 7 of this file, the parser did not find the expected dictionary opening `{` or found an incorrect class declaration.\n\n**Possible causes include:**\n\n- **Incorrect syntax or formatting in `thermophysicalProperties`**: For example, missing braces, misplaced entries, or typos.\n- **Corrupted or malformed file**: The file might have been manually edited incorrectly.\n- **Incorrect class declaration**: Perhaps the file begins with an entry that is not recognized as a dictionary, such as a wrong class name or an unrecognized keyword.\n- **Version mismatch or patch issues**: Since the error references a specific patch, it might relate to compatibility issues or a bug.\n\n**Does this error explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality?**\n\n- It does not mention any dimension mismatch, inequality, or related keywords.\n- The message is about parsing an expected dictionary and encountering an unexpected class name.\n- There is no mention of dimensions `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`, nor any pattern of comparing dimensions or explicit dimension lists.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis error does *not* explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\n---\n\n**Here is my response:**\n\nNo, this error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality. It points to a syntax or formatting issue in the `thermophysicalProperties` file, specifically that the parser expected a dictionary structure but encountered an unexpected class name or malformed content at line 7.",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nThe error message indicates a fatal IO error in OpenFOAM, specifically related to the `thermophysicalProperties` file. The critical line is:  \n`unexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary`  \n\nThis suggests that when OpenFOAM attempts to read the `thermophysicalProperties` file, it encounters an unrecognized or improperly formatted class name. The message indicates that OpenFOAM was expecting a dictionary (i.e., a structured set of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`), but it encountered something else, specifically a class name.  \n\nThe line in question:  \n`file: constant/thermophysicalProperties at line 7`  \n\nand the subsequent mention:  \n`while reading object thermophysicalProperties`  \n\nimply that at line 7 of `constant/thermophysicalProperties`, the syntax or structure does not conform to what OpenFOAM expects for a dictionary.  \n\nIn OpenFOAM, `thermophysicalProperties` should typically start with a line specifying the class type, such as:  \n`thermoType` or similar, and then a dictionary enclosed in braces. For example:  \n```\nthermoType\n{\n    type            heRhoThermo;\n    mixture         gas;\n    transport       ...;\n    thermodynamics  ...;\n}\n```  \n\nIf, instead, at line 7, the file contains just a class name where a dictionary should be, or if the braces are missing or misplaced, OpenFOAM will throw this error.  \n\nThis error does not directly indicate a dimensional inequality. Instead, it points to a formatting or syntax issue in the `thermophysicalProperties` file. The mention of an \"unexpected class name\" and \"expected dictionary\" clearly relates to the structure of the input file, not to the physical dimensions or units themselves.  \n\nTherefore, this is not a pattern of a dimensional inequality. It is a structural syntax error in the input file.  \n\nHere is my response:  \n**no**",

This suggests that OpenFOAM was expecting a dictionary (a structured set of key-value pairs defining properties), but instead encountered a different class name or an incorrectly formatted entry.  \n\nThe mention of \"unexpected class name\" points to a syntax issue or a structural issue within the thermophysicalProperties file. The message does not reference any dimension comparisons, mismatches, or explicit dimension lists such as \"[0 0 0 -1 0 0 0]\" versus \"[0 0 0 -2 0 0 0]\". It is focused on the format and correctness of the file's content, specifically the class name and dictionary structure.\n\nTherefore, this error is not explicitly about dimensional inequality or dimension mismatch patterns.

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe provided error message from OpenFOAM indicates a fatal input/output error related to the thermophysicalProperties file. Specifically, the key line is:\n\n```\nunexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\n    while reading object thermophysicalProperties\n```\n\nThis suggests that when OpenFOAM attempted to read the `thermophysicalProperties` file located in the `constant` directory, it did not find the expected dictionary structure. Instead, it encountered a class name, which implies a formatting or syntax issue in the input file.\n\nThe error points to line 7 of the `constant/thermophysicalProperties` file. Common reasons for this type of error include:\n\n- The file does not start with a proper dictionary opening (`{`).\n- The `thermophysicalProperties` entry is not correctly formatted as a dictionary.\n- The file may contain a class name or object type instead of a dictionary.\n- There could be an accidental insertion of a class declaration or a typo.\n\nThis error does **not** explicitly reference any dimensional inequality or mismatch. It is about the syntax and structure of the input file rather than the physical dimensions or units.\n\nTherefore, the core issue is related to the expected data structure (a dictionary) not being correctly formatted or read properly, not about incompatible dimensions.\n\nHere is my response: **no**",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nThe error message indicates a problem with the format or content of the `thermophysicalProperties` dictionary in the `constant` directory. Specifically, the message:\n\n```\nunexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\n```\n\nsuggests that the parser expected a dictionary structure but encountered something else. It points to line 7 of the `constant/thermophysicalProperties` file, implying that there might be a formatting or syntax issue at or before that line.  \n\nThe mention of \"unexpected class name\" often occurs when the file begins with an object type (like `thermophysicalProperties`) but is not properly formatted as a dictionary. In OpenFOAM, the syntax for such files should follow a structure similar to:  \n\n```\nthermophysicalProperties\n{\n    // properties here\n}\n```\n\nIf the file is missing the opening or closing braces, or if the content is malformed (e.g., missing braces, incorrect indentation, or misplaced entries), the parser will throw this error.  \n\nFurthermore, the message notes:  \n`while reading object thermophysicalProperties` and points to line 7, which suggests that line 7 is either the start of the dictionary or near the beginning of the content.  \n\nThis error is not explicitly about dimensional inequalities or mismatched dimensions; it is about parsing the input file correctly. There are no references to dimension mismatch patterns or inequalities in the provided message.  \n\n**Summary of key points:**\n- The error indicates a formatting issue with the `thermophysicalProperties` file.\n- The file likely does not start with a proper dictionary structure.\n- The error occurs at line 7, implying a problem in or around that line.\n- No explicit mention of dimensional inequalities or mismatched dimensions.\n\n**Therefore, to resolve this:**\n- Check the `constant/thermophysicalProperties` file.\n- Ensure it starts with the correct object name followed by an opening brace `{`.\n- Verify that the entire structure is properly formatted with matching braces.\n- Confirm that the properties are defined correctly within the braces.\n\n---\n\nHere is my response:  \nThe error indicates that the `thermophysicalProperties` file in your `constant` directory is not formatted correctly as a dictionary. Specifically, the parser expects a dictionary structure but encounters an unexpected class name or syntax issue at line 7. This typically results from missing braces, incorrect indentation, or malformed entries in the file. To fix this, ensure that your `thermophysicalProperties` file begins with the object name followed by an opening brace, and that all properties are properly enclosed within braces with correct syntax. Verify that the entire file adheres to the proper OpenFOAM dictionary format to resolve this error.",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe core of this error is a \"FOAM FATAL IO ERROR\" related to the `thermophysicalProperties` dictionary in the `constant` directory. The message indicates an \"unexpected class name\" and states that it \"expected dictionary\" while reading the object. This suggests that OpenFOAM encountered a format or syntax issue in the `thermophysicalProperties` file.\n\nSpecifically, the message:\n```\nunexpected class name thermophysicalProperties expected dictionary\nwhile reading object thermophysicalProperties\nfile: constant/thermophysicalProperties at line 7.\n```\nimplies that at line 7 of the `constant/thermophysicalProperties` file, OpenFOAM was expecting to find a dictionary structure, but instead, it found a class name or some invalid content. \n\nThis kind of error typically occurs if:\n- The file is not properly formatted as a dictionary.\n- There's a typo or incorrect indentation.\n- The structure of the file is corrupted or incomplete.\n- The class name (or object type) is misplaced or incorrectly specified.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, the `thermophysicalProperties` file should start with a dictionary, often like:\n```plaintext\nthermoType\n{\n    type        heRMixture;\n    ...\n}\n```\nor similar, depending on the version and the specific thermophysical model.\n\nLine 7 is a key indicator. If line 7 contains a class name instead of a dictionary, or if there's missing opening/closing braces, it would cause this error.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis error does **not** explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality or a dimension mismatch. It is related to the syntax and structure of the `thermophysicalProperties` file, specifically expecting a dictionary structure but encountering an unexpected class name or invalid format.\n\n---\n\nHere is my response:\n\nThis error indicates a syntax or formatting issue within your `constant/thermophysicalProperties` file. Specifically, at line 7, OpenFOAM expected to read a dictionary structure defining thermophysical properties but encountered an unexpected class name instead. This suggests that the file may be improperly formatted, missing braces, or has a typo that causes OpenFOAM to misinterpret the content.\n\nCommon causes include:\n- Incorrect indentation or missing braces in the dictionary.\n- A misplaced or misspelled class name or keyword.\n- The file not starting with a proper dictionary block.\n\nTo resolve this, review your `constant/thermophysicalProperties` file around line 7. Ensure it adheres to the proper OpenFOAM syntax for a dictionary, with correct braces and key-value pairs. Verify that the first line correctly starts the dictionary and that all nested entries are properly formatted.\n\nThis error is unrelated to dimensional inequalities or dimension mismatches, which typically involve explicit dimension comparisons or error messages referencing incompatible units.",
