The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

All\\nthe cells available in each mixing evaluation planes\\ncontribute for the calculations. This method is more\\naccurate if the gap between two planes is reduced and\\nthe numbers of evaluation planes are increased.\\nTable 3 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

All\\nthe cells available in each mixing evaluation planes\\ncontribute for the calculations. This method is more\\naccurate if the gap between two planes is reduced and\\nthe numbers of evaluation planes are increased.\\nTable 3 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

    "assistant_response": "The OpenFOAM runtime error \"No such container: openfoam-container\" indicates that the Docker container named \"openfoam-container\" does not exist or is not running. This issue is unrelated to controlDict configuration but needs resolution to run OpenFOAM correctly. To fix this, ensure the container is properly created and started before running simulations. Use the following steps:\n\n1. Verify if the container exists by running: docker ps -a | grep openfoam-container. If not listed, proceed to create it.\n2. Create the container with: docker run -dit --name openfoam-container openfoam/openfoam etc.\n3. Start the container with: docker start openfoam-container.\n4. Confirm it’s running with: docker ps | grep openfoam-container.\n5. Re-run your simulation command to ensure the container is available.\n\nRegarding controlDict, ensure the parameters do not violate initial or boundary conditions. Since your initial conditions specify a velocity of 75.18 m/s at inlets and zero gradient pressure outlets, keep deltaT and write intervals consistent with these conditions. For example, set deltaT to a small value like 1e-6 or 1e-5 as in your sample files, and use writeInterval values that do not skip the initial conditions. Also, configure maxCo in controlDict to a value less than or equal to 0.6 to ensure stable time stepping, and set application to reactingFoam as specified. Do not change the startTime, endTime, or boundary conditions in controlDict to maintain initial and boundary condition fidelity.",

Create the container with: docker run -dit --name openfoam-container openfoam/openfoam etc.\\n3. Start the container with: docker start openfoam-container.\\n4. Confirm it’s running with: docker ps | grep openfoam-container.\\n5. Re-run your simulation command to ensure the container is available.\\n\\nRegarding controlDict, ensure the parameters do not violate initial or boundary conditions. Since your initial conditions specify a velocity of 75.18 m/s at inlets and zero gradient pressure outlets, keep deltaT and write intervals consistent with these conditions. For example, set deltaT to a small value like 1e-6 or 1e-5 as in your sample files, and use writeInterval values that do not skip the initial conditions. Also, configure maxCo in controlDict to a value less than or equal to 0.6 to ensure stable time stepping, and set application to reactingFoam as specified.

The error \"No such container: openfoam-container\" indicates that the container does not exist or isn't running, which is unrelated to the controlDict content but essential for running OpenFOAM. The correction advice provides steps to fix the container issue.

I will select key parameters from the provided sample files, prioritizing those that are most relevant and standard for a reactingFoam simulation, such as startFrom, startTime, stopAt, endTime, deltaT, writeControl, writeInterval, and other parameters that influence simulation control and output.\n\nI note that in the original file, the startFrom is set to startTime, and in the sample files, it is often set to latestTime. I will keep it as startTime, as per the original. The endTime is very small (0.0001), which suggests a very short simulation; I will retain that, but I will also ensure the deltaT is compatible. The writeInterval is set to 2, but in the sample files, it's usually a multiple of the number of steps or time units; I will set it to a reasonable value like 1000 or 2, depending on the context.\n\nI will ensure the units and dimensions are correct. For example, deltaT is in seconds, and writeInterval is in terms of time or number of steps, depending on writeControl. Since the original file uses writeFormat ascii, I will keep that, and I will set runTimeModifiable to true to allow runtime modifications.\n\nNow, I will produce the rewritten controlDict with these considerations, maintaining consistency with the sample files and adhering to standard OpenFOAM conventions.\n\nHere is my response:\n\nFoamFile  \n{  \n version 2.0;  \n format ascii;  \n class dictionary;  \n object controlDict;  \n}  \n\napplication reactingFoam;  \n\nstartFrom startTime;  \n\nstartTime 0;  \n\nstopAt endTime;  \n\nendTime 0.0001;  \n\ndeltaT 1e-05;  \n\nwriteControl runTime;  \n\nwriteInterval 2;  \n\npurgeWrite 0;  \n\nwriteFormat ascii;  \n\nwritePrecision 6;  \n\nwriteCompression no;  \n\ntimeFormat general;  \n\ntimePrecision 6;  \n\nrunTimeModifiable true;  \n\n// ************************************************************************* //",

The original file provided is simple, but the samples indicate some variations, such as different endTime, deltaT, writeControl modes, and additional functions inclusion.\n\nKey points:\n- The file should conform to OpenFOAM syntax.\n- Time-related parameters need proper units and dimensions: startTime and endTime are in seconds, deltaT in seconds, writeInterval in seconds.\n- The application is reactingFoam.\n- The file should be well-formatted with consistent indentation.\n- For the control parameters, I will set startFrom to startTime, startTime to 0, stopAt to endTime, and endTime to 0.0001 as in the original.\n- writeControl can be runTime or adjustable; I will choose runTime for simplicity unless specified otherwise.\n- writeInterval is 2 in the original; I will keep that unless a different setting is needed.\n- Additional parameters like purgeWrite, writeFormat, writePrecision, writeCompression, timeFormat, timePrecision, runTimeModifiable are included.\n- The sample files show inclusion of functions; I will include this optionally, but since no specific function is requested, I will not add it unless specified.\n\nHere is my response:\n\nFoamFile  \n{  \n version 2.0;  \n format ascii;  \n class dictionary;  \n object controlDict;  \n}  \n\napplication reactingFoam;  \n\nstartFrom startTime;  \n\nstartTime 0;  \n\nstopAt endTime;  \n\nendTime 0.0001;  \n\ndeltaT 1e-5;  \n\nwriteControl runTime;  \n\nwriteInterval 2;  \n\npurgeWrite 0;  \n\nwriteFormat ascii;  \n\nwritePrecision 6;  \n\nwriteCompression no;  \n\ntimeFormat general;  \n\ntimePrecision 6;  \n\nrunTimeModifiable true;  \n\n// *************************************************************************",

There are no keywords such as \"dimensions,\" \"dimension mismatch,\" or \"incompatible dimensions.\" Additionally, no explicit lists of dimensions (like [0 0 0 -1 0 0 0]) are present.\n\nGiven that the error is about a Docker container's existence and not about any physical or mathematical inconsistency within the simulation—such as a mismatch in physical dimensions or units—there is no indication of a dimensional inequality.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the content and context of this error message, it does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: no",

The sample files provided show variations in parameters like endTime, deltaT, writeInterval, and maxCo. I will aim to produce a clean, consistent version based on the provided data, adhering to best practices for OpenFOAM controlDict files.\n\nKey points:\n- Application: reactingFoam\n- startFrom: startTime\n- startTime: 0\n- stopAt: endTime\n- endTime: 0.0001 (from the original, which is very small; perhaps it should be larger)\n- deltaT: 1e-5 (original)\n- writeControl: runTime or adjustable?

Since the sample files have different endTimes and deltaTs, I will select values that are reasonable for a small simulation: e.g., endTime 0.0001, deltaT 1e-5, writeInterval 2 (from original).

The message is straightforward: the container was not found, likely because it was never created, was deleted, or the name was misspelled.\n\nGiven the pattern to analyze:\n- Does it explicitly mention dimensions or a mismatch? No.\n- Are there keywords like \"dimensions,\" \"dimension mismatch,\" or \"incompatible dimensions\"? No.\n- Is there an explicit list of dimensions or a comparison of such? No.\n- Is the error about a numerical or physical property being inconsistent? No.\n- Is it about syntax, segmentation faults, solver crashes, or similar computational errors? No.\n\nThis error statement is about a container's existence, not about any dimensional inequality or comparison.\n\nHere is my response: no",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nI need to rewrite the controlDict file to match the key formatting and values from the provided sample files. The goal is to maintain a consistent and accurate configuration suitable for a reactingFoam simulation. I should ensure that key parameters such as application name, startFrom, startTime, stopAt, endTime, deltaT, writeControl, writeInterval, writeFormat, writePrecision, writeCompression, timeFormat, timePrecision, runTimeModifiable, and others are correctly set. I also need to pay attention to the formatting style, including indentation, spacing, and the use of comments.\n\nThe original file has:\n\n- startFrom startTime\n- startTime 0\n- stopAt endTime\n- endTime 0.0001\n- deltaT 1e-5\n- writeControl runTime\n- writeInterval 2\n- writeFormat ascii\n- writePrecision 6\n- writeCompression no\n- timeFormat general\n- timePrecision 6\n- runTimeModifiable true\n\nSample files show variations but generally follow similar structure. For example, sample_file_1 uses endTime 1000 with deltaT 1, sample_file_6 uses endTime 1 with deltaT 1e-5, and sample_file_7 uses endTime 1500 with deltaT 1. The writeInterval varies but is often set to a value matching the simulation duration or a small value.\n\nGiven the original endTime is very small (0.0001), and deltaT is 1e-5, it might be best to keep the simulation duration consistent with the original. Since the original writeInterval is 2 (which is a large value relative to endTime), perhaps setting writeInterval to a fraction of endTime or a fixed small interval would be better for output frequency.\n\nI will keep the structure similar to sample_file_1, since it appears well-balanced for small timeframes, with endTime 1000, deltaT 1, and writeInterval 20.\n\nNow, I will prepare the rewritten controlDict:\n\n- application: reactingFoam\n- startFrom: startTime\n- startTime: 0\n- stopAt: endTime\n- endTime: 0.0001 (matching original)\n- deltaT: 1e-5\n- writeControl: runTime\n- writeInterval: 2 (matching original, but could consider larger for better output frequency)\n- writeFormat: ascii\n- writePrecision: 6\n- writeCompression: no\n- timeFormat: general\n- timePrecision: 6\n- runTimeModifiable: true\n\nFormatting should be consistent with the sample files, including indentation and spacing.\n\nHere is my response:\n\nFoamFile  \n{  \n  version 2.0;  \n  format ascii;  \n  class dictionary;  \n  object controlDict;  \n}  \n\napplication reactingFoam;  \n\nstartFrom startTime;  \n\nstartTime 0;  \n\nstopAt endTime;  \n\nendTime 0.0001;  \n\ndeltaT 1e-5;  \n\nwriteControl runTime;  \n\nwriteInterval 2;  \n\npurgeWrite 0;  \n\nwriteFormat ascii;  \n\nwritePrecision 6;  \n\nwriteCompression no;  \n\ntimeFormat general;  \n\ntimePrecision 6;  \n\nrunTimeModifiable true;",

If present:\n        a) Identify the missing file path from the error message\n        b) Format the response as 0/..., system/..., or constant/...\n        3. If absent/irrelevant: Respond with no\n\n1. Respond ONLY with a filename (format: 0/xx, system/xx, or constant/xx) if required\n2. Respond ONLY with 'no' if no file needed\n3. Strict formatting requirements:\n- No special characters: (), '', \", `\n- No markdown/formatting symbols\n- No whitespace, line breaks, or indentation\n- No explanations or extra text\nYour response must be exactly one of:\na) A directory-path formatted string from allowed locations\nb) The lowercase string 'no'\nExamples of valid responses:\nsystem/fvSchemes\nconstant/g\nno\n",

They also shared sample files from tutorials that demonstrate different decomposition methods and configurations, including `scotch`, `hierarchical`, and `simple`, with varying numbers of subdomains and coefficients. Based on this, I need to produce a comprehensive `decomposeParDict` file that correctly reflects a typical setup, including the dictionary header, the number of subdomains, the chosen decomposition method, and relevant coefficients if applicable. Since the user's initial file is minimal, I will assume they want a more complete and practical example, similar to the samples provided. I will choose a method and configuration that makes sense, for example, `scotch` with 3 subdomains, which is a common choice. I will also ensure the formatting and syntax are correct and consistent with OpenFOAM standards.\n\nHere is my response:  \n\nFoamFile  \n{  \n    version     2.0;  \n    format      ascii;  \n    class       dictionary;  \n    object      decomposeParDict;  \n}  \n\n// Decomposition configuration for parallel run  \nnumberOfSubdomains 3;  \n\nmethod          scotch;  \n\n// Optional: specify coefficients if needed (for hierarchical method)  \n// coeffs  \n// {  \n//     n           (1 1 3);  \n// }  \n\n// End of file",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the purpose of the new controlDict file. Since the original files vary in parameters such as endTime, deltaT, writeControl, and others, I should choose appropriate values based on typical simulations or specific needs. The user wants a rewritten version with proper formatting and key values, ensuring the dimensioning is correct if shown.\n\nGiven that, I will:\n\n- Use the same structure as the original files: the FoamFile header, followed by the key-value pairs.\n- Set application to reactingFoam.\n- Use startFrom startTime and startTime 0.\n- Decide on a reasonable endTime, for example, 500 (or as per user needs), but since the original files have different endTimes, I could set it to 1000 for a longer simulation.\n- Set deltaT to a value appropriate for the problem; if high accuracy is needed, smaller deltaT like 1e-6; for longer runs, larger like 1.\n- Choose writeControl: runTime for longer simulations, or adjustable for more control.\n- WriteInterval: based on the simulation length and desired output frequency.\n- Set writeFormat to ascii or binary; ascii for readability.\n- Set writePrecision to 6 or higher, depending on accuracy needs.\n- Keep runTimeModifiable true to allow runtime changes.\n- Adjust maxCo, maxDeltaT as per stability requirements.\n- Include or exclude functions as needed.\n\nNow, I will assemble the rewritten controlDict with these considerations, maintaining proper formatting and key values, ensuring the dimensioning is correct. Since no explicit dimensions are given in the original, I will follow the typical conventions.\n\nHere is my response:\n\nFoamFile\n{\n    version     2.0;\n    format      ascii;\n    class       dictionary;\n    object      controlDict;\n}\n// * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * //\napplication     reactingFoam;\nstartFrom       startTime;\nstartTime       0;\nstopAt          endTime;\nendTime         1000;\ndeltaT          1;\nwriteControl    runTime;\nwriteInterval   20;\npurgeWrite      0;\nwriteFormat     ascii;\nwritePrecision  6;\nwriteCompression no;\ntimeFormat      general;\ntimePrecision   6;\nrunTimeModifiable true;\nadjustTimeStep  yes;\nmaxCo           1;\nlibs            (semiPermeableBaffle);\n// ************************************************************************* //",

If absent/irrelevant: Respond with no\n\n1. Respond ONLY with a filename (format: 0/xx, system/xx, or constant/xx) if required\n2. Respond ONLY with 'no' if no file needed\n3. Strict formatting requirements:\n- No special characters: (), '', \", `\n- No markdown/formatting symbols\n- No whitespace, line breaks, or indentation\n- No explanations or extra text\nYour response must be exactly one of:\na) A directory-path formatted string from allowed locations\nb) The lowercase string 'no'\nExamples of valid responses:\nsystem/fvSchemes\nconstant/g\nno\n",

This error is related to Docker container management and does not inherently contain any mention of missing files or file paths. Since the task is to analyze for the presence of \"cannot find file\" and, if present, identify the missing file path, in this case, the phrase \"cannot find file\" is absent. Therefore, no file needs to be reported.\n\nHere is my response:  \nno",

They provided an original file and several example files, some with different parameters such as startFrom, endTime, deltaT, writeControl, writeInterval, and writePrecision. They emphasized avoiding markdown code block markers and extra comments.\n\nGiven this, I will craft a clean, well-formatted controlDict file, choosing appropriate values for a reactingFoam simulation, ensuring consistency and clarity. I will assume a typical simulation running from 0 to 1000 seconds with a time step of 1 second, writing output every 20 seconds, which aligns with the original file content.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Mixing evaluation planes.\\n4 Results\\nObservations of the mixing behavior were the main\\nobjective in results analysis. Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12.

Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

All\\nthe cells available in each mixing evaluation planes\\ncontribute for the calculations.

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nFirst, I need to analyze the provided original `controlDict` file and understand its structure and key parameters. Then, I will identify the main differences and typical conventions from the sample files you provided to ensure consistency in formatting, key values, and units/dimensions where applicable.  \nThe original file uses `application reactingFoam;`, has a startFrom set to `startTime`, a startTime of 0, stops at `endTime` 10, with a deltaT of 0.01. The write control is based on `timeStep`, with an interval of 100, format ascii, precision 6, no compression. Time format is general, and runTimeModifiable is true. There is a function block for probes.  \n\nComparing with the samples:  \n- The sample files specify `startFrom latestTime;` or `startFrom startTime;` with a startTime of 0, stopAt endTime, and varying endTime values.  \n- The sample files differ in `writeControl` (`runTime`, `adjustable`, `timeStep`) and `writeInterval`.  \n- The `deltaT` varies significantly, matching the simulation needs.  \n- The format (`ascii` or `binary`) varies, but for consistency, I will stick with `ascii`.  \n- The `writePrecision` varies; the original uses 6, but sample 6 uses 10, so I will opt for 10 for higher precision.  \n- The `writeControl` is set to `timeStep` in the original; in sample 2 and 6, it's `adjustable`. For flexibility, I will use `adjustable` with `maxCo` and `maxDeltaT` parameters if needed.  \n\nBased on these observations, I will rewrite the `controlDict` to be comprehensive, consistent, and properly formatted, with logical parameter choices.  \n\nHere is my response:  \n\nHere is the rewritten `controlDict` file, formatted for clarity and consistency, with key parameters adjusted for typical use and aligning with the sample files provided:  \n\nFoamFile  \n{  \n    version     2.0;  \n    format      ascii;  \n    class       dictionary;  \n    object      controlDict;  \n}  \n  \napplication     reactingFoam;  \n  \nstartFrom       startTime;  \nstartTime       0;  \n  \nstopAt          endTime;  \nendTime         10;  \n  \ndeltaT          0.01;  \n  \nwriteControl    adjustable;  \nwriteInterval   100;  \npurgeWrite      0;  \nwriteFormat     ascii;  \nwritePrecision  10;  \nwriteCompression off;  \n  \ntimeFormat      general;  \ntimePrecision   6;  \n  \nrunTimeModifiable true;  \n  \nfunctions  \n{  \n    probes  \n    {  \n        type        patchAverage;  \n        libs        (\"libsampling.so\");  \n        patches     (\"all\");  \n        fields      (\"p\", \"U\", \"nut\");  \n    }  \n}  \n\nThis configuration uses `writeControl` set to `adjustable`, with a `writeInterval` of 100. The `writePrecision` is increased to 10 to match sample preferences for higher precision output. Time format remains `general`, and runTimeModifiable is enabled for flexibility. The function block for probes remains unchanged. Adjust parameters further based on your specific simulation needs.",

I will set endTime to 10 for simplicity unless otherwise specified.\n- deltaT: keep 0.01 as in original.\n- writeControl: switch to \"runTime\" for consistent time-stepped writing.\n- writeInterval: choose 100 for a balance, or 10 for more frequent output; original is 100.\n- writeFormat: ascii.\n- writePrecision: 10 to match original.\n- writeCompression: off.\n- timeFormat: general.\n- timePrecision: 6.\n- runTimeModifiable: true.\n- functions: keep the same with probe sampling at all patches, fields \"p\", \"U\", \"nut\".\n\nHere is the final, clean, properly formatted controlDict file:\n\nFoamFile  \n{  \n    version     2.0;  \n    format      ascii;  \n    class       dictionary;  \n    object      controlDict;  \n}  \n\napplication     reactingFoam;  \n\nstartFrom       startTime;  \nstartTime       0;  \n\nstopAt          endTime;  \nendTime         10;  \n\ndeltaT          0.01;  \n\nwriteControl    runTime;  \nwriteInterval   100;  \npurgeWrite      0;  \nwriteFormat     ascii;  \nwritePrecision  10;  \nwriteCompression off;  \n\ntimeFormat      general;  \ntimePrecision   6;  \n\nrunTimeModifiable true;  \n\nfunctions  \n{  \n    probes  \n    {  \n        type        patchAverage;  \n        libs        (\"libsampling.so\");  \n        patches     (\"all\");  \n        fields      (\"p\", \"U\", \"nut\");  \n    }  \n}",

I will also verify that the key values make sense for a typical reactingFlow simulation, and if any units or dimensions are involved, I will note them accordingly.\n\nGiven the sample files, I notice the following variations:\n\n- Different `endTime` values (0.5, 1, 10), indicating different simulation durations.\n- Different `deltaT` values (1e-6, 1e-5, 1e-3), indicating different time step sizes.\n- Different `writeInterval` values (0.05, 0.02, 0.1).\n- Different `maxCo` (0.4, 0.3, 1), which is the Courant number.\n- Additional parameters like `maxDeltaT` in one sample.\n- The `libs` entry includes `semiPermeableBaffle` in one sample.\n\nSince no specific target parameters are specified, I will produce a generic, well-formatted `controlDict` that can be adapted as needed.

Common indicators of dimensional inequality in computational or simulation errors include:\n\n- Explicit mention of dimensions or units, such as \"[0 0 0 -1 0 0 0]\" which represent SI base units exponents.\n- Phrases like \"dimension mismatch,\" \"incompatible dimensions,\" or \"dimensional inequality.\"\n- Error messages that compare or evaluate the dimensions of variables, parameters, or fields directly, often with explicit dimension vectors.\n\nIn this case, the error message is about Docker container management and does not contain any reference to dimensions, units, or physical quantities.

The key parameters such as `application`, `startFrom`, `startTime`, `stopAt`, `endTime`, `deltaT`, `writeControl`, `writeInterval`, `purgeWrite`, `writeFormat`, `writePrecision`, `writeCompression`, `timeFormat`, `timePrecision`, `runTimeModifiable`, `adjustTimeStep`, `maxCo`, and `libs` will be set appropriately.\n4. I will also consider the context: if the original file specifies `startFrom startTime;` and `startTime 0;`, then the case begins at time zero. The `endTime` should be set according to the simulation duration.\n5. The `deltaT` should be set to a value suitable for the simulation stability and accuracy. For example, if the original file has `deltaT 1e-3;`, I will keep that unless instructed otherwise.\n6. The `writeControl` can be `adjustable` or `runTime` depending on the original or desired behavior.\n7. The `writeInterval` should be consistent with `writeControl`. For `adjustable`, it can be a small value; for `runTime`, it can be specified as a number of seconds.\n8. The `maxCo` (Courant number) should be specified with the correct units and typical value; for example, `maxCo 1;`.\n9.

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe original `controlDict` file provided is for an OpenFOAM simulation using `reactingFoam`. The user wants a rewritten version that is comprehensive and detailed, with proper formatting and correct key values, including the correct dimension if necessary. Since the original file doesn't explicitly specify dimensions, but this is important for some parameters like `maxCo`, I need to ensure that the parameters are correctly set, especially `maxCo`. Also, I must remove any code block markers or extra comments, providing only the clean, formatted configuration.\n\nKey points:\n\n- Keep the structure consistent with OpenFOAM's expectations.\n- Ensure `application` is set to `reactingFoam`.\n- Use `startFrom` as `startTime`.\n- Set `startTime` to 0.\n- `stopAt` to `endTime`.\n- Set `endTime` appropriately; for example, 10 seconds.\n- `deltaT` should be a small time step, e.g., 1e-3.\n- Choose `writeControl` and `writeInterval` as per typical practice, e.g., `adjustable` and 0.1, unless otherwise specified.\n- Set `writeFormat` to `binary` for efficiency.\n- Set `writePrecision` to 6 for a good balance of precision.\n- `writeCompression` off.\n- `timeFormat` as `general`.\n- `timePrecision` as 6.\n- `runTimeModifiable` set to `true`.\n- `adjustTimeStep` as `yes`.\n- For `maxCo`, ensure the units/dimensions are correct; `maxCo` is usually a dimensionless number representing the Courant number, so 1 is acceptable.\n- Include `libs` if necessary, e.g., `(semiPermeableBaffle)` as in the original, but this depends on the case setup.\n- Remove extra comments and ensure clean formatting.\n\nHere is my response:\n\nHere is the rewritten `controlDict` file with proper formatting, key values, and consistent structure:\n\nFoamFile\n{\n    version     2.0;\n    format      ascii;\n    class       dictionary;\n    object      controlDict;\n}\n// ************************************************************************* //\n\napplication     reactingFoam;\n\nstartFrom       startTime;\n\nstartTime       0;\n\nstopAt          endTime;\n\nendTime         10;\n\ndeltaT          1e-3;\n\nwriteControl    adjustable;\n\nwriteInterval   0.1;\n\npurgeWrite      0;\n\nwriteFormat     binary;\n\nwritePrecision  6;\n\nwriteCompression off;\n\ntimeFormat      general;\n\ntimePrecision   6;\n\nrunTimeModifiable true;\n\nadjustTimeStep  yes;\n\nmaxCo           1;\n\nlibs            (semiPermeableBaffle);\n\n// ************************************************************************* //",

The user wants a rewritten controlDict with proper formatting, correct key values, and ensuring the dimension is accurate if it appears in the file content. The user also provides reference files, which can help verify formatting and key values.\n\nKey points:\n- Maintain proper indentation and spacing.\n- Correct key values based on the reference files.\n- Ensure the units and dimensions are correct if specified.\n- Avoid markdown code block markers or extra comments in the final output.\n\nNow, I will compare the original file and the reference files to identify any discrepancies or improvements.\n\nOriginal file key points:\n- application: reactingFoam\n- startFrom: startTime\n- startTime: 0\n- stopAt: endTime\n- endTime: 10\n- deltaT: 1e-3\n- writeControl: adjustable\n- writeInterval: 0.1\n- purgeWrite: 0\n- writeFormat: binary\n- writePrecision: 6\n- writeCompression: off\n- timeFormat: general\n- timePrecision: 6\n- runTimeModifiable: true\n- adjustTimeStep: yes\n- maxCo: 0.4\n\nFrom reference files:\n- The formatting is consistent across files.\n- The keys are the same.\n- The values seem appropriate for a typical reactingFoam simulation.\n- In sample_file_6, endTime is 1, deltaT is 1e-5, writeInterval is 0.02, maxCo is 0.3, and maxDeltaT is specified, but in the original, maxDeltaT is not present.\n- In sample_file_8, maxCo is 1, which is higher than in the original.\n- The dimension isn't explicitly shown in the original, but in OpenFOAM controlDict, units are implied by the context. For example, deltaT is in seconds.\n\nI will revise the controlDict to incorporate a clean style, correct key indentation, and parameters consistent with the reference files. I will also add maxDeltaT where appropriate, based on the reference.\n\nGiven the original ends at maxCo: 0.4, but reference sample_file_6 uses 0.3, and sample_file_8 uses 1, I will set maxCo to 0.4 as in the original unless otherwise specified.\n\nFinal notes:\n- Keep the application as reactingFoam.\n- startFrom: startTime\n- startTime: 0\n- stopAt: endTime\n- endTime: 10\n- deltaT: 1e-3\n- writeControl: adjustable\n- writeInterval: 0.1\n- purgeWrite: 0\n- writeFormat: binary\n- writePrecision: 6\n- writeCompression: off\n- timeFormat: general\n- timePrecision: 6\n- runTimeModifiable: true\n- adjustTimeStep: yes\n- maxCo: 0.4\n- Optionally, include maxDeltaT: 0.25 (as in sample_file_6) for safety in stability, since it is present in one reference file.\n\nNow, I will prepare the final controlDict with these considerations.\n\nHere is my response:\n\napplication     reactingFoam;\n\nstartFrom       startTime;\n\nstartTime       0;\n\nstopAt          endTime;\n\nendTime         10;\n\ndeltaT          1e-3;\n\nwriteControl    adjustable;\n\nwriteInterval   0.1;\n\npurgeWrite      0;\n\nwriteFormat     binary;\n\nwritePrecision  6;\n\nwriteCompression off;\n\ntimeFormat      general;\n\ntimePrecision   6;\n\nrunTimeModifiable true;\n\nadjustTimeStep  yes;\n\nmaxCo           0.4;\n\nmaxDeltaT       0.25;",

It is a typical container management error, often occurring when trying to stop, remove, or interact with a container that does not exist or has already been deleted.  \n\nKey points to consider:  \n- The error is about the absence of a container with a specific name.  \n- There is no mention of dimensions, units, or any kind of physical quantity comparison.  \n- No references to \"dimensions,\" \"dimension mismatch,\" or explicit lists of units or dimensions.  \n- The error does not involve any numerical or physical property comparisons; it is purely about container existence.  \n- It is not related to code syntax, runtime segmentation faults, or solver crashes.  \n\nBased on this analysis, the error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality. It is a system/container management error unrelated to physical dimensions or units comparison.  \n\nHere is my response:  \nno",

It suggests that a command tried to interact with a container that does not exist or has been removed.\n\nNext, I analyze whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality. Dimensional inequalities in CFD or physics simulations generally involve comparisons of units or dimensions, such as length, time, velocity, etc. They are characterized by explicit references to units or dimensions, often shown with brackets like [m], [s], or complex vectors like [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0].\n\nIn this error message:\n\n- There are no references to units, dimensions, or their mismatches.\n- There are no keywords like \"dimensions,\" \"incompatible dimensions,\" or \"dimension mismatch.\"\n- There are no explicit lists of dimensions or comparisons between them.\n- The message is about Docker container existence, not about any physical or mathematical dimension comparisons.\n\nGiven that, this error is purely about Docker container management and does not involve any explicit dimension comparisons or inequalities.\n\nHere is my response: no",

This type of error typically relates to container management issues, such as trying to start, stop, or access a Docker container that hasn't been created or has been removed.\n\nIn terms of analyzing whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, I need to look for patterns that specify mismatched or incompatible physical dimensions, such as explicit comparisons of units, dimensions, or their inequality statements. Common indicators include phrases like \"dimension mismatch,\" \"incompatible dimensions,\" or explicit dimension arrays like \"[0 0 0 -1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 -2 0 0 0]\".\n\nIn this error message, there are no such references.

Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12.

Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF.

A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1.

The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

There are no references to dimensions, units, or any form of dimension mismatch.

The primary goal is to produce a well-formatted controlDict with correct key values, proper formatting, and appropriate units/dimensions if applicable. I need to ensure that the formatting matches the standard OpenFOAM syntax, with correct indentation and spacing, and that the key values reflect typical or logical settings for a reactingFoam simulation, considering the differences in startTime, endTime, writeInterval, etc., from the sample files.\n\nGiven the sample files, I see that the main differences are in the `startFrom`, `endTime`, and `writeInterval` parameters, as well as `writeFormat` and `writePrecision`.\n\nI will produce a controlDict with a consistent style, choosing a typical simulation configuration. I'll assume a simulation that starts from the latestTime, runs up to 5000 seconds, with a deltaT of 1 second, writing output every 1000 seconds in binary format with higher precision.

It is a runtime error related to container management, not an error related to the internal physics, units, or dimensions within OpenFOAM itself.  \n\nThe key points to analyze are:  \n- The error is about a container not existing, which is a system-level issue.  \n- There are no references to units, dimensions, physical quantities, or their mismatches.  \n- The error does not mention any comparison, inequality, or mismatch of dimensions like [dim1] != [dim2].  \n- It does not include any explicit dimension lists or talks about dimensional consistency.  \n\nBased on this analysis, the error is not explicitly about dimensional inequality. It is about the absence of a container in the Docker environment.

The message pertains to container management and does not contain any references to dimensions, units, or physical quantities.  \n\nI am to determine if this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality. The criteria for that are:  \n- The presence of imbalanced dimension comparisons, such as [dim1] != [dim2], or similar expressions indicating mismatch in physical units.  \n- Keywords related to dimensions or mismatches, like \"dimensions,\" \"incompatible dimensions,\" or \"dimension mismatch.\"  \n- Explicit dimension lists that show inequality, e.g., [0 0 0 -1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 -2 0 0 0].  \n\nSince the error message does not contain any of these patterns, references, or keywords, it seems to be a Docker container error unrelated to physical dimensions or units.

This kind of error is related to container management, specifically Docker, and not directly related to the internal physics or numerical aspects of OpenFOAM simulations.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, dimensional inequalities typically appear as error messages during the simulation run, often formatted to indicate that certain physical quantities do not have compatible units or dimensions. These errors often include specific dimension vectors (e.g., [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0]) and compare them explicitly, such as \"dimension mismatch: [1 0 0 0 0 0 0] != [0 1 0 0 0 0 0]\".\n\nThe key point is whether the provided error explicitly references such dimension vectors or mentions incompatible dimensions. In this case, the error is about a Docker container not being found; there are no mentions of dimensions, units, or mismatched dimension vectors.\n\nTherefore, since the error is about a container's existence and not about dimensional analysis or unit consistency, it does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response:  \nno",

The key points are:\n\n- Retain the structure and formatting style.\n- Keep the application as \"reactingFoam.\"\n- Choose appropriate startFrom option (\"latestTime\" or \"startTime\").\n- Set startTime to 0.\n- Define stopAt as \"endTime\" and set endTime accordingly.\n- Use deltaT = 1.\n- Set writeControl to \"runTime\" with a suitable writeInterval.\n- Keep purgeWrite at 0.\n- Use binary format, writePrecision 10, writeCompression off.\n- Use general timeFormat, timePrecision 6.\n- Make runTimeModifiable true.\n- For some files, adjust parameters based on the sample: for example, sample_file_7 uses endTime 1500, sample_file_5 uses 5000, sample_file_1 uses 1000.\n- Ensure that the formatting mimics the original style, including the comment lines and spacing.\n\nGiven these observations, I will produce a controlDict file with a consistent, clean, and correct structure, choosing parameters that seem most common in the examples, and ensuring proper indentation and formatting.

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nThe user wants a rewritten controlDict file for OpenFOAM with proper formatting, key values, and correct dimensioning if applicable. They provided the original file content and some sample files for reference. I need to ensure the output is clean, well-structured, and consistent with OpenFOAM standards, avoiding markdown code blocks or extra comments.  \n\nKey points to consider:  \n- Maintain the correct syntax and indentation.  \n- Set the application to \"reactingFoam\" as per original.  \n- Use `startFrom` as `startTime` or similar, depending on the sample files.  \n- Set `startTime`, `stopAt`, `endTime`, `deltaT`, and other parameters logically and consistently.  \n- `writeControl` could be `adjustable` or `runTime`, based on sample files.  \n- `writeInterval` should be reasonable, possibly smaller for detailed output.  \n- Ensure `writeFormat`, `writePrecision`, `timeFormat`, and `timePrecision` are set properly.  \n- Confirm `maxCo`, `maxDeltaT`, and `adjustTimeStep` are appropriate for reacting flows.  \n- Remove any unnecessary or conflicting entries.  \n\nBased on the sample files:  \n- Some use `startFrom startTime`, others `latestTime`. I'll choose `startTime` for simplicity.  \n- `stopAt endTime` with `endTime` set as needed.  \n- `writeControl` varies: `adjustable`, `runTime`. I will choose `adjustable` for flexibility.  \n- `writeInterval` varies; I will set it to a reasonable value like 0.1 or 0.02 depending on the simulation duration.  \n- `writePrecision` varies; I will set to 6 or 10 as in samples.  \n- For reacting flows, `maxCo` is often set to a value like 1 or less, depending on the flow. I'll choose 1 as a safe default.  \n- The `libs` entry in the original is `semiPermeableBaffle`; I will include it as is.  \n\nHere is my response:  \n\n---\n\napplication     reactingFoam;  \nstartFrom       startTime;  \nstartTime       0;  \nstopAt          endTime;  \nendTime         10;  \ndeltaT          1e-3;  \nwriteControl    adjustable;  \nwriteInterval   0.1;  \npurgeWrite      0;  \nwriteFormat     binary;  \nwritePrecision  6;  \nwriteCompression off;  \ntimeFormat      general;  \ntimePrecision   6;  \nrunTimeModifiable true;  \nadjustTimeStep  yes;  \nmaxCo           1;  \nlibs            (semiPermeableBaffle);",

Since no dimension is explicitly given, I will assume standard OpenFOAM conventions.\n\nIn particular, I notice that the sample files show different configurations: some use startFrom startTime with startTime 0, others use latestTime, and some specify different endTimes and deltaTs.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Mixing evaluation planes.\\n4 Results\\nObservations of the mixing behavior were the main\\nobjective in results analysis. Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12.

Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe provided error message is: \"Error response from daemon: No such container: openfoam-container\". This message is generated by Docker (or a similar container engine) and indicates that the container with the name or ID \"openfoam-container\" does not exist or cannot be found at the time of the command's execution. It is a runtime error related to container management, not directly related to OpenFOAM's internal computations or physics.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, dimension mismatches or dimensional inequalities typically produce error messages explicitly referencing \"dimensions,\" \"dimensional,\" \"incompatible dimensions,\" or similar terminology. They often include specific dimension vectors (like [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0]) that indicate mismatched physical units for quantities such as velocity, pressure, etc., during the setup or execution of the solver.\n\nThe key point here is that the error in question relates to the Docker daemon and the existence of a container, not to any computational or physical dimension inconsistency inside OpenFOAM. There are no references to dimensions, dimension vectors, or comparisons of physical units in the error message.\n\nTherefore, this error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: no",

Instead, it's a straightforward Docker error about a missing container, unrelated to any physical or mathematical dimensions.\n\nTherefore, the error does not explicitly reference any dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: no",

It specifies the version, format, class, object, dimensions, internalField, and boundaryField. The user asks to rewrite this file, presumably with some modifications, but the exact modifications are not specified. Since the user provided a sample file and asked for a rewrite, I will assume they want an improved or adjusted version, possibly aligning with the sample files' structure, boundary types, or values.\n\nThe key points I observe:\n- The original internalField is uniform 300, which is typical for temperature.\n- Boundary conditions are all zeroGradient, which is common for insulated boundaries.\n- The dimensions are `[0 0 0 1 0 0 0]`, representing temperature in Kelvin (since the 4th exponent is 1).\n- The file structure is correct.\n\nGiven the sample files, I notice they sometimes use different boundary conditions like fixedValue or inletOutlet, depending on the physical scenario. The sample files also have comments and a clear boundaryField structure.\n\nWithout specific instructions, I will produce a clean, well-formatted version of the original file, perhaps adjusting the internalField to a more typical value if needed, and ensuring the formatting matches the sample style.

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:  \nThe user wants a rewritten version of the \"0/p\" file for an OpenFOAM case, based on the original file's structure and the provided sample files. The key points are: maintain correct formatting, ensure the key values are appropriate, and preserve the dimensions. The sample files indicate typical boundary conditions and internal field values. The original file has a zero gradient boundary condition everywhere, but the samples show the use of total pressure boundary conditions with specified p0 values and more detailed boundary conditions. Since the user provided multiple sample files with different internalField values (101325 Pa, 1e5 Pa), I will choose a common standard value for initial pressure, such as 101325 Pa, which is standard atmospheric pressure. I will also adopt the boundary conditions from the sample files, replacing the original zeroGradient at all boundaries with a configuration similar to sample_file_5, which includes inlets, outlet with totalPressure, and other walls with zeroGradient.

The original file contains essential simulation control parameters, and the goal is to produce a clean, well-structured version with consistent style and accurate values.\n\nFirst, I will start with the FoamFile header, which specifies version, format, class, and object.

This message originates from Docker, the containerization platform, and indicates that a request was made to interact with a container named \"openfoam-container\" that does not exist or is not currently running. This is a runtime error related to Docker's container management system, not related to OpenFOAM's internal computations or their dimensional analysis.  \n\nThe specific error does not reference any physical quantities, units, dimensions, or any form of dimensional analysis. It lacks mentions of dimensions, incompatible dimensions, or explicit dimension lists. It is a straightforward message about the non-existence of a container entity, and such errors are typically caused by incorrect container names, the container not being started, or the container having been removed.  \n\nTherefore, this error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality, as it does not involve any comparison of physical dimensions, units, or their mismatches.  \n\nHere is my response:  \nno",

This is a runtime error related to container management rather than a computational or numerical error within OpenFOAM itself.\n\nWhen analyzing whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, I look for references to dimensions, units, or comparisons of physical quantities that involve dimension checks. Typical patterns include messages about incompatible dimensions, mismatched units, or explicit dimension vectors like [0 0 0 -1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 -2 0 0 0].\n\nIn this case, the error is about a missing container, which is a Docker-related issue. It does not mention any dimensions, units, or comparisons of physical quantities. There are no references to dimensional analysis, dimension vectors, or incompatible units.\n\nTherefore, this error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: no",

Since the user emphasizes formatting and key values, I will replicate the structure precisely and avoid unnecessary elements.\n\nHere is my response:\n\nHere is my response:\n\nFoamFile  \n{  \n    version     2.0;  \n    format      ascii;  \n    class       dictionary;  \n    object      controlDict;  \n}  \n  \napplication     reactingFoam;  \n  \nstartFrom       startTime;  \n  \nstartTime       0;  \n  \nstopAt          endTime;  \n  \nendTime         100;  \n  \ndeltaT          1;  \n  \nwriteControl    runTime;  \n  \nwriteInterval   20;  \n  \npurgeWrite      0;  \n  \nwriteFormat     ascii;  \n  \nwritePrecision  6;  \n  \nwriteCompression off;  \n  \ntimeFormat      general;  \n  \ntimePrecision   6;  \n  \nrunTimeModifiable true;  \n  \nfunctions  \n{  \n    #include \"FOBilgerMixtureFraction\"  \n}",

The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Mixing evaluation planes.\\n4 Results\\nObservations of the mixing behavior were the main\\nobjective in results analysis. Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006).

However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 .

The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively.

Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006).

The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively.

Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11.

However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

I should preserve the structure and key parameters but may need to adjust or clarify certain values, especially for consistency and correctness. The original file indicates the application is reactingFoam, with a simulation starting at time 0 and ending at 0.5 seconds, with a timestep of 1e-6. The write control is set to \"adjustable\" with an interval of 0.05, and the maximum Courant number is 0.4. The functions include an include directive for \"FOBilgerMixtureFraction\".\n\nI will ensure the formatting matches typical OpenFOAM controlDict standards, with proper indentation and spacing.

This message comes from Docker (or a similar container runtime) and indicates that an attempt was made to interact with a container named \"openfoam-container\" that does not exist or is not currently running. This is a runtime error related to container management, specifically about the existence of a container, not about numerical computations, units, or dimensions.\n\nThe instructions specify analyzing whether the error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, characterized by:\n\n- Imbalanced dimension comparisons (e.g., [dim1] != [dim2], or a != b where a and b are dimensions).\n- Keywords like dimensions, incompatible dimensions, or dimension mismatch.\n- Explicit dimension lists (e.g., [0 0 0 -1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 -2 0 0 0]).\n\nIn this case, the error message does not contain any of these patterns. It does not mention dimensions, units, or any comparison between quantities with units. Instead, it is a straightforward message about the non-existence of a specified container in Docker.\n\nTherefore, this error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: **no**",

These errors often occur during compilation or runtime when the code attempts to perform operations between quantities with incompatible units or dimensions.\n\nSince this error message does not mention any dimensions, units, mismatched dimensions, or related keywords, and instead references a container management issue, it does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: no",

Usually, such errors point to specific configuration or input files required by OpenFOAM. These files are typically located in directories like system, constant, or within the case directory itself.  \n\nGiven the typical structure of OpenFOAM case directories, missing files often relate to configuration files in system or constant directories, or input files in the case directory. The format for the response should be one of the specified directory paths, formatted in lowercase, without special characters, whitespace, or extra formatting.  \n\nIn the absence of an actual error message, I will demonstrate the expected response format assuming a common missing file scenario. For example, if the missing file is \"system/fvSchemes\", the response should be \"system/fvSchemes\" in lowercase.  \n\nIf no such phrase is present, I should respond with \"no\".  \n\nHere is my response:  \nno",
