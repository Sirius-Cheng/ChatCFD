The main\\ngoal was the gas-gas mixing simulation comparison\\nbetween ANSYS Fluent and OpenFOAM. The same\\nANSYS mesh was used for each case in both codes. The\\n“reactingFoam” solver and species transport models\\nwere used for handling the species in OpenFOAM and\\nANSYS Fluent respectively. The reactingFoam solver is\\na transient solver and ANSYS Fluent was simulated at\\nsteady state condition. Standard k-ε model was used to\\npredict the turbulence effect in both computational fluid\\ndynamics codes. OpenFOAM gave a higher mixing\\nlevel compared to ANSYS Fluent. Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

All\\nthe cells available in each mixing evaluation planes\\ncontribute for the calculations. This method is more\\naccurate if the gap between two planes is reduced and\\nthe numbers of evaluation planes are increased.\\nTable 3 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14. Ammonia mass fraction across a jet (mass\\nfractions were plotted along the vertical lines those lines\\nare shown in Figure 13).\\nFigure 15.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8. Ammonia mass fraction case-3; (a) OF, (b)\\nFigure 9. Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF.

Chemical species\\nmomentum predictions are more diffusion in\\nOpenFOAM and more convective in ANSYS Fluent.\\nKeywords: OpenFOAM, ANSYS Fluent, CFD, mass\\nfraction, standard deviation, mixing\\n1 Introduction\\nOpenFOAM (OF) is a free computational fluid\\ndynamics (CFD) code developed by OpenCFD Ltd and\\nOpenFOAM Foundation. This CFD code is getting well\\nknown in academic and industrial sector due to a broad\\nrange of fluid dynamics applications, open source, no\\nlimitation for parallel computing, and no limitation of\\nnumber of species in the chemistry models (Lysenko et\\nal., 2013). ANSYS Fluent (AF) is a commercial code\\nand it is developed for the CFD simulation with\\npowerful graphical user interface. It was developed and\\nmaintained by ANSYS Inc. It is possible to achieve the\\nsame result from both OF and AF by examining “the\\nexterior flow field around simplified passenger sedan”\\ngeometry (Ambrosino and Funel, 2006). Reynolds-\\naveraged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS equations)\\nwith the k-ε model can be used for both OF and AF CFD\\ncodes. OF predicts more accurate results for the velocity\\nand AF predicts more accurate results for the turbulent\\nkinetic energy (Balogh et al., 2012). According to the\\nanalyze of “turbulence separated flows” using OF and\\nAF, turbulence models give closely equal results from\\nthe both CFD codes (Lysenko et al., 2013). The main\\nobjective of this work is to compare the OF simulation\\nability with the AF simulation for gas-gas single phase\\nmixing. OpenFOAM 2.4.0 and ANSYS Fluent R16.2\\nacademic version were used for the simulations. These\\ngeometry designs are unique models for an industrial\\napplication and there are no published experimental\\nresults.\\n2 Solvers selection\\nThe solver selection is an important step in this study.\\nChemical and physical properties of the system are\\nconsidered for the solver selection. The continuity\\nequation is required to keep the mass balance constantly.\\nThe momentum equation contributes to calculate the\\nvelocities and the pressures. This system was operated\\nat an isothermal condition. However, the energy\\nequation was required to predict the densities at the\\noperating pressure and temperature. A multispecies\\nmodel was required because of air-ammonia mixing.\\nThe flow was turbulent. Therefore, a turbulence model\\nwas required to predict the turbulence properties. The\\nfluid flow highly interacts with walls and mixer plates.\\nTherefore, a wall treatment method is required.\\n2.1 The species transport model\\nA species transport equation is given in Equation-1. It\\ndescribes the convection and the diffusion of the species\\n𝑖 for a unsteady condition without a reaction (Fluent,\\n2006; Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007).\\n+div(𝜌𝑈𝑌\\n)=−div(𝐽\\nHere, 𝜌 is the density of species 𝑖 , 𝑌\\nis the mass fraction\\nof species 𝑖 , 𝑈 is the three dimensional velocity\\ncomponents, 𝑡 is time, 𝐽\\nis the diffusion flux of species\\n𝑖 , and 𝑆\\nis the source term of species 𝑖 . The mass\\ndiffusion in a turbulent flow is given as,\\n=−𝜌𝐷\\ngrad(𝑌\\ngrad(𝑌\\n) (2)\\nHere 𝜇\\nis the turbulent viscosity and 𝑆𝑐\\nis the turbulent\\nSchimidt number. The reaction term was neglected\\nbecause of only the air-ammonia mixing.\\n2.2 Solvers parameters comparison\\nA comparison of solvers parameters is shown in Table\\n1. OF was a transient simulation and AF simulation was\\na steady state simulation. Most of the OF chemical\\nsolvers are transient solvers. However, AF has both\\ntransient and steady state solvers for the chemical\\nspecies. A steady state solver was selected for AF to\\nsave the computational time. Ammonia and air are in the\\nAF chemical species database. However, OF does not\\nhave a database for chemical species. Therefore,\\nmolecular weight, heat capacity, heat of fusion, dynamic\\nPage 3:\\nviscosity and Prandtl number were added as the species\\nproperties.\\n“reactingFoam” is a compressibility based solver.\\nCompressibility is defined as inverse of the\\nmultiplication of the temperature and the universal gas\\nconstant (𝑅𝑇) −1 (Greenshields, 2015). The temperature\\nwas a constant and the fluid mixer gases were\\nconsidered as perfect gases in this study. Therefore, the\\ncompressibility was constant for the “reactingFoam”\\nsimulations. The pressure velocity coupling was\\nhandled in two different ways in both CFD codes.\\nPIMPLE algorithm was created by merging the Pressure\\nImplicit with Splitting of Operators (PISO) algorithm\\nand the Semi Implicit Method for Pressure Linked\\nEquations (SIMPLE) algorithm (Versteeg and\\nMalalasekera, 2007). The PIMPLE algorithm operates\\nat PISO mode if the non-orthogonal correction number\\nhigher than one (Greenshields, 2015). In this simulation,\\nthe non-orthogonal correction number was equal to two.\\nTherefore the pressure velocity coupling was handled by\\nthe PISO algorithm in OF. The PISO contains an extra\\ncorrection step compare to the SIMPLE. Therefore, OF\\ncalculations were with an extra correcting than AF\\ncalculations in these simulations. These algorithms\\nshould not influence the solutions. It influences to the\\nsolution calculation methods.\\nTable 1 .

In this sketch, the ammonia-injecting\\npipe and the static mixer modules are not presented.\\n3.1 Geometries drawing\\nThe ANSYS DesignModeler (DM) tool was used to\\nmake the drawings. The purpose of the designs was to\\nmix air and ammonia in the horizontal circular tube. The\\ngeometries were drawn based on the data given by\\nYARA International ASA. The parts of the geometry are\\nammonia injecting pipe, static mixer plates and\\ncylindrical tube walls.\\nThe geometries were drawn in three cases as “without\\nammonia injecting pipe and without static mixture\\nmodules” (case-1), “with ammonia injecting pipe and\\nwithout static mixer modules” (case-2) and “with\\nammonia injecting pipe and with static mixer modules”\\n(case-3).\\nThe total length of the large pipe is 5.5 m and diameter\\nis 0.996 m. The length of the ammonia-injecting pipe is\\n1.473 m and diameter is 0.25 m (the small cylindrical\\npipe with holes). Figure 2 shows the geometries for\\nabove-mentioned three cases. There are a 10 numbers of\\nholes in the ammonia-injecting pipe and the diameter of\\na hole was 80 mm. The mixer plates were drawn as zero\\nthickness walls to reduce the number of elements in the\\nmeshes. There were four number of mixer modules and\\nthe mixer plates arrangements were similar in each\\nmodule but module 2 and 4 were rotated around the pipe\\ncentral axis by 90°.\\nFigure 1. Air and ammonia inlets, outlet and flow\\ndirections.\\n3.2 Mesh generation\\nThe same mesh was used for simulation in both CFD\\ncodes in each case for an accurate comparison. Three\\nmeshes were generated with respect to the above\\nmentioned three geometry cases. These meshes are\\nshown in Figure 3 and the element types are shown in\\nTable 2. The minimum and maximum element sizes are\\n2.88 mm and 288 mm respectively for all 3 cases. More\\ntetrahedral elements are added when the complexity is\\nincreased in the geometries. Inflation layers are added to\\nbetter prediction in near the walls and the mixer plates.\\nThe total number of cells is increased by five times due\\nto inclusion of the static mixer.\\n3.3 Boundary conditions and initial values\\nfor OF and AF\\nThe boundary conditions were named as\\n“velocity_inlet_air”, “velocity_inlet_nh3”,\\n“pressure_outlet” and “walls”. The velocity inlet type\\nwas selected by assuming an incompressible fluid. A\\ncomparison of boundary conditions is shown Table 3.\\nThe air inlet velocity was 23.98 m/s. The turbulence\\nintensities were 1.7 % and 1.9 % in air inlet and\\nammonia inlet respectively. All the outer cylinder\\nsurfaces and mixer plates were considered as the walls.\\nThe walls were assumed as “no slip” condition and there\\nwas no heat transfer through the walls.\\n3.4 Mixing Evaluation Method\\nMixing evaluation can be done using a “mixer\\nparameter” (Kok and van der Wal, 1996). It is based on\\nthe standard deviation of species mass fraction. The\\nsample points are considered in a line. This model was\\nPage 4:\\nconsidered as the basic model for the mixing evaluation\\nin this study. The same basic mixing evaluation method\\nwas applied for this study in a different manner to\\nevaluate the mixing of ammonia and air. Ten number of\\nmixing evaluation planes were defined after the static\\nmixer modules. The mixing evaluation planes were\\ncircular cross sections of the large cylindrical pipe as\\nshown in Figure 4. The gap between two subsequent\\nplanes is 100 mm. These mixing evaluation planes are\\nlocated after the static mixer modules to evaluate the\\nfluid coming out from static mixer modules. Standard\\ndeviation values of ammonia mass fraction were\\ncalculated for the each mixing evaluation planes. All\\ncells available in a mixing evaluation plane were\\nconsidered to calculate a standard deviation value. Ten\\nnumber of standard deviation values were calculated for\\na geometry model. Standard deviation values were\\nplotted against x/D values for the each geometry\\nmodels.\\nFigure 2 . Geometry; (a) Case-1, (b) Case-2, (c) Case-\\n(a) (b)\\nFigure 3 . Mesh cross sectional view; (a) Case-1, (b)\\nCase-2, (c) Case-3.\\nHere, x is the axial position from air inlet and D is the\\nlarge circular pipe diameter. If the curve gives a lower\\nvalues line, the design gives a better mixing than the\\nothers. If the curve gives a higher values line, the design\\ngives a lower mixing than the others. The mixing\\nevaluation model proposed in this study was more\\naccurate than the basic model and easy to compare with\\nthe similar geometry models.\\nTable 2 .

Computational time\\noptimization was not focused in this study.\\nPage 5:\\n4.1 Case-1\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 5\\nfor both CFD codes. The OF simulation showed a bit\\nmore diffusive flow patterns compared to the AF. The\\nAF simulation showed longer convective ammonia\\nchannels. These channels became less diffusive toward\\nthe outlet in AF compared to OF. A higher mixing level\\nwas shown in the OF simulation compared to AF as\\nshown in Figure 6 (OF showed lower standard deviation\\nvalues). It was due to a higher diffusive behavior of OF\\nsimulation. Mixing level was further increased towards\\nthe outlet because the residence time increased. This\\nwas basically due to macro mixing. When the residence\\ntime increases, the interaction between molecules\\nfurther increases.\\nFigure 5 . Ammonia mass fraction contours case -1; (a)\\nOF, (b) AF.\\n4.2 Case-2\\nTheoretically, a perfect mixing gives a stoichiometric\\nmixture. The stoichiometric ammonia mass fraction was\\nequal to 0.16 for these simulations. Ammonia mass\\nfraction was plotted along the central axis line in large\\ncircular pipe as shown in Figure 7.\\nAmmonia mass fraction was zero in – 0.65 < x/D < 0\\nrange, because of large upstream airflow. This implies\\nthat there was no backflow of ammonia. At the ammonia\\ninlet tube – 0.125 < x/D < 0.125, ammonia mass fraction\\nwas equal to one. This means that there was no initial air\\nremaining in the ammonia-injecting pipe at the steady\\nstate. There was an increment in ammonia mass fraction\\nclose to x/D = 0.35. This was due to the position of\\nmonitoring line, which was placed between two\\nconservative holes of the injector. At x/D > 2.5,\\nammonia mass fraction was a constant value in the AF\\nsimulation. However, there was a fluctuation in the OF\\nsimulation. This was basically due to “wiggles”\\nformation in OF simulation. These “wiggles” patterns\\ngenerated with transient simulation in OF. As well as,\\nthe “wiggles” helped to increase the mixing in OF\\ncompared to AF. However, the OF result was\\nfluctuating around the AF results. Therefore the average\\nammonia mass fraction value of OF was almost similar\\nto the AF result.\\nFigure 6 . Mixing evaluation – case-1 (standard\\ndeviation of ammonia mass fraction).\\n4.3 Case-3\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours are shown in Figure 8.\\nBoth CFD codes show similar contours in this case.\\nStandard deviation of ammonia mass fraction is shown\\nin Figure 9. Case-3 showed lowest standard deviation\\nvalues from both CFD codes compared to the previous\\ncases (case-1 and case-2). This implies that the static\\nmixer has improved the mixing. OF simulation result\\nshowed higher mixing (lower standard deviation values)\\nin case-3 compare to AF.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at x/D = 4.85 (this\\nlocation is the 10th mixing evaluation plane in Figure 4)\\nis shown in Figure 10. The range of ammonia mass\\nfraction was shown from 0.1 to 0.2 to compare with\\nperfect mixing. A perfect mixing was given at ammonia\\nmass fraction equal to 0.16 from a stoichiometric\\nmixture. Higher perfect mixing regions were shown in\\nOF compared to AF. Further, ammonia mass fraction (0\\nto 1 range) was plotted along the vertical line (the\\nvertical line is shown in Figure 10) at x/D = 4.85 as\\nshown in Figure 11. Here y is the vertical axis position\\n(y negative means bellow the center of the circular\\nplane). It also showed that OF simulation showed higher\\nammonia mass fraction regions than AF.\\nPage 6:\\nFigure 7 . Ammonia mass fraction along the central\\naxis – case-2.\\nFigure 8.

Mixing evaluation - case 3 (standard deviation\\nof ammonia mass fraction).\\nThe average turbulent kinetic energy of the mixing\\nevaluation planes (the mixing evaluation planes are\\nshown in Figure 4) are shown in Figure 12. Higher\\naverage turbulent kinetic energy was predicted by OF\\nthan AF. Turbulent kinetic energy is reduced toward the\\noutlet due to decay of turbulence.\\nFigure 10. Ammonia mass fraction contours at x/D =\\n4.85; (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Mesh quality requirement comparison\\nbetween OF and AF\\nQuality of the mesh is one of the key parameter to\\ncontrol the accuracy and the stability of the\\ncomputational schemes (Fluent, 2006). Skewness is\\nused to check the quality of the mesh in generally. Case-\\n3 geometry was used to simulate the different skewness\\nmeshes in this experiment. OF was able to simulate only\\nless than 0.78 maximum skewness meshes. However,\\nAF simulated maximum skewness up to 0.93. This\\nmeans that AF has more ability to handle low quality\\nmesh than OF.\\nPage 7:\\n5.2 Jet mixing comparison between OF and\\nWhen a fluid mixes with another fluid, velocity shear\\nlayers are created between two fluids (Yuan et al.,\\n2004). Ammonia coming out from the small holes can\\nbe considered as non-premixed turbulent jet flows.\\nAmmonia mass fraction contours at the first hole is\\nshown in Figure 13 for the both CFD codes.\\nConcentration of ammonia was decreased, when mixing\\noccurred. AF showed comparatively longer shear\\nboundaries. OF shear boundaries were wider than AF\\nboundaries. Figure 14 shows ammonia mass fraction\\nacross the jet in a vertical line. The vertical lines are\\nshown in Figure 13. These lines were selected at same\\ndistance from the injector pipe. Ammonia mass fraction\\naround the jet was larger in OF while the ammonia mass\\nfraction at the center of the jet was larger in AF. This\\nimplies that, higher diffusion was shown in OF and\\nhigher convection was shown in AF. This was a reason\\nfor the OF showed higher mixing because of higher\\ndiffusion effect.\\n5.3 Vortex street formation comparison\\nFlow around the cylinder creates turbulent vortexes at\\nRe > 3.5 ×10 6 range (Fluent, 2006). The average\\nReynolds number was 3.8 ×10 6 in these simulations.\\nVortex formation comparison around ammonia\\ninjecting pipe is shown in Figure 15 (velocity contours).\\nOF showed a higher vortex street formation compared\\nto AF. These high number of vortex streets formation\\ncaused the higher mixing level in OF compared to AF.\\nVortex streets are averaging in steady state simulation\\nbut not in transient simulations. OF simulation was in\\ntransient mode and AF simulation was in steady state\\nmode. Therefore, transient simulation increased the\\nmixing compared to the steady state simulation.\\nFigure 11. Ammonia mass fraction along the vertical\\nlines at x/D = 4.85(y negative is below the center of\\nplane and vertical lines are shown in Figure 10).\\nFigure 12. Turbulent kinetic energy comparison – case\\n3 (Average turbulent kinetic energy in mixing\\nevaluation planes).\\nFigure 13. Jet mixing at first hole in injector; (a) OF, (b)\\n5.4 Eddy prediction comparison between OF\\nand AF\\nThe standard k-ε model was used by both CFD codes for\\nturbulence prediction. Figure 16 shows large and small\\neddies in OF and AF. The same locations were\\nPage 8:\\nconsidered for the comparison in both codes. The large\\neddies were possible to see in between the cylindrical\\nwall and the mixer plates. More large eddies were\\npredicted by AF than OF. However, small eddies were\\ncomparatively equally predicted in the both codes.\\nFigure 14.

Large and small eddies (large circles and\\nsmall circles show large eddies and small eddies\\nrespectively); (a) OF, (b) AF.\\n5.5 Turbulence kinetic energy effect\\ncomparison between OF and AF\\nEnergy cascade path starts with main flow energy to\\nlarge eddies, large eddies energy to small eddies, small\\neddies energy to smallest eddies and finally to internal\\nenergy (Versteeg and Malalasekera, 2007). OF\\nsimulation showed higher turbulent kinetic energy than\\nAF in this study. These high turbulent kinetic energies\\nhelped to create more vortices in OF according to the\\nenergy cascade principle. Because of this, higher mixing\\nwas shown in OF compared to AF.\\n5.6 Summary of OF and AF results\\ncomparison\\nA summary of result comparison is shown in Table 4.\\nTable 3 . Summary of OF and AF results comparison.\\nDescription\\nStatic mixer model\\nWithout static mixer OF gives higher mixing\\nWith static mixer Both codes give on average equal mixing\\n6 Conclusions\\nBoth codes used same constant values for k-ε equation\\nand same initial values. Higher turbulent kinetic energy\\nwas predicted from OF compared to AF. As well as\\nhigher diffusive properties was shown in OF compared\\nto AF. Those two reasons were mainly involved to\\npredict the higher mixing in OF compared to AF. OF\\nsimulation is required higher quality mesh compare to\\nAF. As an example, 0.93 maximum skewness mesh\\ngives a converged result in AF but same mesh gives a\\ndiverged result in OF. This implies that finer mesh is\\nPage 9:\\nrequired for OF. Both codes used the ANSYS meshes,\\nwhich are designed for AF.\\nAcknowledgment\\nThe authors express their thanks to Luigi Serraiocco,\\nJakub Bujalski and YARA International ASA for useful\\ntechnical support.\\nReferences\\nF.

This typically points to a syntax issue in a script or command string being run, where a quotation mark wasn't properly closed.\n\nThe question asks whether this specific error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality in OpenFOAM, with guidance to look for patterns such as imbalanced dimension comparisons, keywords referencing dimensions, or explicit dimension lists.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, a dimensional inequality error (like `[0 0 0 1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 2 0 0 0]`) indicates a mismatch between physical dimensions, often caused by incompatible units or improper variable assignments. These errors are usually printed as explicit messages mentioning \"dimensions\", \"dimension mismatch\", or showing the specific dimensions involved.\n\nHowever, the current error is a Bash syntax error related to unmatched quotation marks, which is a scripting or command syntax problem, not a physics or mathematical dimension mismatch. It does not include any references to dimensions, dimension lists, or inequality comparisons.\n\nTherefore, this error is not explicitly about dimensional inequality; it is about shell syntax, not physical units or dimensions.\n\nHere is my response: **no**",

The error occurs at line 1 of `controlDict`, suggesting there may be an issue with the syntax or content of that file.\n\nThe detailed traceback points to a function involved in reading files (`uncollatedFileOperation::readStream`), implying that the problem is likely related to how OpenFOAM is attempting to read or interpret the `controlDict` file.\n\nThe question asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, such as mismatched units or incompatible dimensions. It provides guidance on identifying such patterns, including checking for dimension mismatches in the error message, especially with explicit dimension lists.\n\nIn this case, the error message does not mention any dimensions, dimension mismatch, or incompatible units. It explicitly states that the problem is with reading the header of `controlDict`, which points more towards a syntax or formatting issue, rather than a units or dimension mismatch.\n\nGiven that:\n\n- The error is about reading a file header.\n- No mention of dimensions, units, or mismatched dimension expressions.\n- The error occurs at the file parsing level, not during physical calculations or unit checking.\n\nTherefore, this error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: **no**",

Instead, it points to a problem with reading the file header, which is typically related to syntax or formatting issues rather than dimensional conflicts.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe error is related to reading the `fvSchemes` file header and most likely caused by formatting or syntax issues at the beginning of the file, not by dimensional inequality.\n\n---\n\n**Here is my response:**\n\nNo",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe error message indicates a fatal input/output error related to reading the header for the object `fvSchemes` from the file `system/fvSchemes`. The specific line in the code where the error occurs points to the function responsible for reading input streams, suggesting an issue with the file's content or structure. \n\nThe key clues are:\n- \"problem while reading header for object fvSchemes\"\n- The error originates from the function `uncollatedFileOperation::readStream`.\n- The file involved is `system/fvSchemes`, and the problem occurs at line 1, which is typically at the very start of the file.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, `fvSchemes` is a dictionary file that specifies the discretization schemes for different terms in the finite volume method. It must be correctly formatted, with proper syntax and valid entries. If `fvSchemes` is malformed, missing, or has syntax errors, OpenFOAM cannot read it properly, leading to such IO errors.\n\nCommon causes include:\n- The `fvSchemes` file is missing or renamed.\n- The file is empty or corrupted.\n- Syntax errors or incorrect formatting within `fvSchemes`.\n- Unusual characters or encoding issues at the start of the file.\n- Mismatch or incompatible versions that change the expected format.\n\nThis error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality, which would typically involve dimension checks within the file or during the reading of field data. Instead, it is related to file reading and parsing, pointing to a file format or content problem.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the provided error message, the issue is primarily about reading the header of `fvSchemes`, which suggests a formatting or file integrity problem rather than a dimensional mismatch.\n\nHere is my response: \n\n**no**",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe provided error message is a \"FOAM FATAL IO ERROR\" indicating a problem while reading the header for the object `fvSchemes` from the file `system/fvSchemes` at line 1. The error occurs during an attempt to read the file, specifically in a function related to file operations (`uncollatedFileOperation`). This suggests that the issue is associated with the contents or structure of the `system/fvSchemes` file.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, `fvSchemes` defines the discretization schemes used in the numerical solution, including the type of schemes and their respective parameters. The error at line 1 implies that the problem might be with the syntax, formatting, or the data within that file rather than a runtime dimensional mismatch, which typically involves the physical units or dimensions in the simulation setup.\n\nThe instruction asks to determine if the error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, such as mismatched units or incompatible dimensions. Since the error message explicitly points to an issue with reading the header of `fvSchemes` and mentions a file operation failure, it is more indicative of a syntax or formatting issue rather than a dimension mismatch. Errors related to dimension inconsistencies in OpenFOAM usually specify dimension arrays (like `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]`) and mention \"dimension mismatch\" or similar phrases, which are absent here.\n\nGiven that the error is about reading the header and does not mention dimensions, units, or mismatched dimension arrays, and considering that `fvSchemes` is typically a configuration file with scheme definitions, the problem is likely with the file's syntax, formatting, or content structure rather than a physical unit or dimensional inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, this error does **not** explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: **no**",

The message does not mention \"cannot find file\" or any missing file explicitly.

Typical signs of such an error include explicit mentions of dimensions, dimension lists, or inequality of dimensions (e.g., [0 0 0 -1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 -2 0 0 0]). \n\nSince the error message does not mention any dimensions, units, or mismatched dimensional lists, and instead points to a problem with reading the header of a configuration file, it suggests that the root cause is related to file formatting or syntax issues rather than a direct dimensional mismatch.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided error message, I conclude that this is not an explicit indication of a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: no",

The specific line in the file where the error occurs is line 19. The error originates from a function involved in reading files, specifically in the context of uncollated file operations.\n\nThis kind of error typically suggests that there is an inconsistency or corruption in the initial conditions or boundary conditions defined in the '0/p' file. Common causes include:\n\n- Incorrect formatting or syntax in the initial condition file.\n- Mismatch between the expected data format and the provided data.\n- Problems with the header section of the file, such as missing information or incorrect dimensions.\n- An inconsistency in the dimensions of the pressure field 'p' compared to other fields or expected values.\n\nGiven that the error explicitly mentions \"problem while reading header for object p\" at line 19, it strongly suggests that the issue is with the header's content — most notably, the dimensions associated with the field 'p'. In OpenFOAM, each field's header includes a line specifying its dimensions, such as:\n\n```\ndimensions      [1 -1 -2 0 0 0 0];\n```\n\nIf there's a mismatch or syntax error here, the parser will throw an error.\n\nNow, considering the instruction about dimensional inequalities: the error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality or mismatch between dimensions. It points to a problem reading the header, which could be caused by formatting issues, missing dimensions, or incorrect syntax, rather than a direct comparison of dimensions that are incompatible.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: **no**",

The error is a fatal one, indicating that during execution, OpenFOAM attempted to access this file (which typically contains initial or boundary condition data) and was unable to locate it.

The message is about a missing file, which is a file system or data input issue rather than a physical or mathematical inconsistency related to units or dimensions.  \n\nThe guidance is to determine if the error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, by checking for patterns such as unequal dimensions, keywords related to dimensions, or explicit dimension lists that do not match. Since the error does not mention dimensions, units, or any mismatch in physical quantities, and is solely about a missing file, it does not seem to pertain to dimensional analysis or incompatible dimensions.  \n\nTherefore, the answer to whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality is: **no**.  \n\n---\n\n**Here is my response:**  \nNo.",

The error occurs during the reading process within the file operations, specifically in the function `uncollatedFileOperation::readStream`. The key point is that the simulation code is trying to access a file named \"T\" in the initial conditions directory, but it cannot locate it.\n\nThis type of error typically relates to the following issues:\n- The initial condition file \"T\" does not exist in the specified directory.\n- The filename or path specified in the case setup is incorrect.\n- There was an error in setting up the case, such as missing files or misconfiguration.\n- The case files were not correctly copied or generated before running the simulation.\n\nThe question asks if this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, which would involve pattern recognition such as mismatched units or dimensions in the data files or parameters. The error message, however, does not mention dimensions, units, or any form of dimensional comparison. It is a straightforward file-not-found error.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided error, it does not indicate a dimensional inequality or mismatch explicitly. It is primarily a file I/O issue.\n\nHere is my response: \n\nno",

Specifically, the error states that the file \"/home/openfoam/case/v1/ChatCFD/run_chatcfd/aoa10_spalartALLMARAS_0/0/T\" cannot be found. The context suggests that the simulation expects an initial condition file for temperature (\"T\") located in the \"0\" directory, but this file is absent or incorrectly specified.\n\nThis error is about a missing file rather than a dimensional inconsistency. The message does not mention any dimension mismatch, incompatible units, or explicit dimension comparisons. Instead, it points to a file path issue, which is a common setup or data input problem in OpenFOAM cases.\n\nThe note about checking for patterns like dimension inequalities, mismatched units, or explicit dimension lists is generally relevant when the error concerns physical quantities and their units or dimensions. Since this error clearly relates to a file that does not exist, and there is no mention of dimension conflicts, it indicates that the primary problem is the missing input file, not a dimensional inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the nature of the error, the answer to whether the error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality is:\n\n**no**",

This is a runtime file required during the simulation, likely representing initial or boundary conditions for the temperature field 'T' at the start of the case. The key point is that the file is missing or misplaced, which leads to the fatal error.\n\nThe question asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, characterized by pattern differences such as mismatched dimensions in the case setup, explicit mention of dimension lists (e.g., [0 0 0 -1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 -2 0 0 0]), or keywords like \"dimensions,\" \"incompatible dimensions,\" or \"dimension mismatch.\"\n\nAnalyzing the provided error, the core issue is a missing file, not a dimensional inconsistency. The error does not mention any dimension mismatches, incompatible units, or dimension-related keywords. Instead, it reports a file not found error during reading a dataset.\n\nTherefore, this specific error is about a missing file and does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response:  \n**no**",

Since the path is absolute and starts with \"/home\", which is typical for user directories, but the allowed prefixes are system, constant, or 0, the closest match is the directory \"0\" within the case directory.

The error points to the file operation during the reading process, specifically in the function `uncollatedFileOperation::readStream`, and references line 629 of `uncollatedFileOperation.C`. \n\nImportantly, the error does not mention any issues related to dimensions, units, or mismatched dimensions explicitly. It is a straightforward file-not-found error, which is a common cause of runtime failures in OpenFOAM when a required initial or boundary condition file is missing or incorrectly specified.\n\nThe question asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality—such as mismatched units, inconsistent dimensions in equations, or dimension comparisons. Typical patterns for such errors include references like `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 1 0 0 0]` or messages about incompatible dimensions. Since the error here is about a missing file and not about dimensions, no such pattern is present or implied.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the provided error message and the instructions, the answer is:\n\n**no**",

The path indicates that the missing file is within the '0' directory of the case setup. According to typical OpenFOAM case directory structure, initial condition files are stored in the '0' directory.

The error occurs during a file operation, specifically within the `uncollatedFileOperation::readStream` function, which suggests that OpenFOAM is trying to read a file (likely an initial condition, boundary condition, or a time directory) but cannot locate it.\n\nThe key points are:\n- The file path points to a directory structure where multiple time directories are stored (e.g., \"0\" directory for initial conditions).\n- The missing file is \"T,\" which in OpenFOAM typically represents the temperature field.\n- The error is not directly related to a dimensional mismatch or an inequality of units or dimensions but rather to a missing file.\n\nRegarding the question about whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality:\n- The error does not mention any dimension mismatch, units inconsistency, or any comparison of dimensions.\n- It is a file-not-found error, which pertains to file existence, not dimensional analysis.\n\n**Therefore, the answer to whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality is:**\n\n**no**",

Since the message indicates a missing file and the path is within the '0' directory under the case directory, it suggests that the required initial condition file for T (temperature or a similar variable) is missing from the initial time directory. Given the context, such files are typically located in the case's constant or system directories, but in OpenFOAM, initial condition files are stored in the time directory, which in this case is '0'. The path fits the pattern of a case directory structure.\n\nSince the error is about a specific file missing from the initial time directory, the most appropriate response, adhering to the specified format, is the directory path where the file is expected to reside.\n\nHere is my response:  \n0",

The error occurs during a file operation within the global file handling routines, specifically at line 629 of \"uncollatedFileOperation.C\". The critical part of the message is that the file \"T\" (likely a temperature or related field) is missing from the expected directory.\n\nThis type of error is related to file I/O issues, not directly to dimensional analysis or mismatched units. The message does not reference any dimension comparisons, unit mismatches, or dimension lists. It simply states that the file cannot be found, which typically points to problems like:\n\n- The initial condition file \"T\" was not created or was deleted.\n- The case setup is incomplete or incorrect.\n- The file path is wrong or the file has been misplaced.\n- There was a previous error during mesh generation or preprocessing that prevented writing the \"T\" file.\n- The simulation is attempting to read a file that hasn't been generated yet.\n\nGiven that the question asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, and based on the content of the error message, there is no mention of dimensions, units, or any mismatch in physical quantities. The error is about missing files, which is a file system or case setup issue, not a physical units inconsistency or dimension mismatch.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether this error indicates a dimensional inequality is:\n\n**no**",

    "assistant_response": "Here is my thought process:\n\nThe provided OpenFOAM error message indicates a fatal error caused by the software being unable to find a specific file during runtime. The key line is:\n\n\"cannot find file \"/home/openfoam/case/v1/ChatCFD/run_chatcfd/aoa10_spalartALLMARAS_0/0/T\"\"\n\nThis suggests that at some point during execution, OpenFOAM expected to read or access the initial conditions or a related input file named \"T\" located in the directory specified, but the file does not exist or is not accessible.\n\nThe error occurs within a function related to file operations, specifically during the reading of a file stream. The mention of \"uncollatedFileOperation\" and \"readStream\" points towards an issue with file input/output rather than a direct dimensional mismatch or a units/dimensions problem.\n\nThe question asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, such as mismatched dimensions or incompatible units, by looking for patterns like:\n\n- Imbalanced dimension comparisons (e.g., [dim1] != [dim2])\n- Keywords like \"dimensions\", \"incompatible dimensions\", \"dimension mismatch\"\n- Explicit dimension lists (e.g., [0 0 0 -1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 -2 0 0 0])\n\nSince the error message explicitly states that a specific file cannot be found, and does not mention anything about dimensions, units, or dimension mismatch, it is focused on a file access problem.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: \n\n**no**",

The error message explicitly states that OpenFOAM cannot find the file \"/home/openfoam/case/v1/ChatCFD/run_chatcfd/aoa10_spalartALLMARAS_0/0/T\". The error occurs during a file operation, specifically in the function `uncollatedFileOperation::readStream`, and points to a line in the source code (`uncollatedFileOperation.C at line 629`).\n\nThis error is about a missing initial condition file, which is commonly named \"T\" for temperature in OpenFOAM case directories. The file path suggests that OpenFOAM is trying to read the initial temperature field but cannot locate the file at the specified location.\n\nThe question then asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, such as imbalanced dimensions or mismatched units/dimensions (e.g., [0 0 0 -1 0 0 0] != [0 0 0 -2 0 0 0]). It suggests looking for patterns like dimension mismatches or explicit dimension comparison errors.\n\nIn this case, the error does not mention any dimension mismatch, incompatible dimensions, or explicit dimension comparisons. It solely indicates that the file \"T\" cannot be found. This is a file missing error, not a dimensional inconsistency or mismatch.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information and typical pattern recognition, this error does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response:  \n**no**",

The path indicates that the missing file is in the \"0\" directory under the case directory, which is typical for initial condition files in OpenFOAM. Since the path is within the case directory and the filename is \"T\", which is a standard temperature initial condition, the correct reference is likely within the case's zero (0) directory.

This suggests a file path issue, likely because the temperature initial condition file \"T\" does not exist or is misplaced in the expected directory. The error occurs when OpenFOAM tries to read this file during simulation initialization or setup.\n\nThe question asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, such as a mismatch in physical units or dimensions (e.g., pressure units vs. velocity units), or explicitly references dimension comparisons like \"[0 0 0 -1 0 0 0]\" vs. \"[0 0 0 -2 0 0 0]\". Typically, OpenFOAM errors related to missing files are file path or existence issues, not dimension mismatches.\n\nDimension mismatch errors usually involve explicit comparisons between quantities or their units, often during physical property calculations or boundary condition definitions, and the error messages explicitly mentioning incompatible dimensions or mismatched dimension vectors.\n\nSince the error here is about the missing file \"T\" and not about incompatible units or dimension comparisons, it does not explicitly indicate a dimensional inequality.\n\nHere is my response: no",

Based on the instructions, I need to identify the missing file path and format the response accordingly. The path indicates that the missing file is located within the zero (0) directory of the case folder, which is typical for initial conditions or boundary data in OpenFOAM. The path is under the case directory and within the zero folder, so the response should be formatted as a directory-path from the allowed locations. Since the path is from the case directory, it is best represented starting from the case folder directory structure. Given the format requirements, I will respond with the path starting from the case directory upwards, i.e., \"system\" or \"constant\" or \"0\". The missing file is explicitly named \"T\" and located inside the 0 directory, so the appropriate response is the path to that directory.  \n\nHere is my response:  \n0",

The message explicitly states that the file cannot be found, which suggests a missing initial condition or boundary condition file in the case setup directory.  \n\nThe error originates from the function `uncollatedFileOperation::readStream`, which is responsible for reading input files during the simulation startup. The reference to \"0/T\" indicates that it is trying to read the initial temperature field (or a similar scalar field named \"T\" in the time directory \"0\") but cannot locate it.  \n\nThis kind of error is common when the user has either not generated the initial condition files, accidentally deleted or misplaced them, or the case setup is incomplete or incorrectly specified. It does not explicitly indicate an issue with dimensional analysis, units, or any form of dimension mismatch. Instead, it points to a missing file necessary for the run to proceed.  \n\nRegarding the instruction to determine if the error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality:  \n- The error message does not mention dimensions, units, or any kind of mismatch related to units or dimensions.  \n- It only states that a specific file cannot be found.  \n\nTherefore, the error is unrelated to dimensional inequalities or mismatched units.  \n\nHere is my response:  \n**no**",

It does not mention any dimension lists or inequalities between dimensions. The part about `Foam::autoPtr<Foam::ISstream>` and `uncollatedFileOperation` indicates a file reading operation failure rather than a dimensional inconsistency.\n\nIn OpenFOAM, dimension mismatch errors typically involve explicit messages about incompatible units, dimension arrays, or inequality signs (e.g., `[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] != [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]`).

This suggests that during the simulation setup or execution, OpenFOAM expected to read the initial condition or boundary condition file \"T\" (which typically represents temperature) in the specified case directory, but it was missing.\n\nThe error occurs within the function `uncollatedFileOperation::readStream`, which handles reading files. The key point is that the file \"T\" is missing or improperly specified, leading to this fatal error and termination of the run.\n\nThis error does **not** explicitly reference any dimensional inequality, incompatible dimensions, or dimension mismatch. It is directly related to a missing file, not to a problem of units, dimensions, or their consistency.\n\nNow, based on the instructions:  \n- If the error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, I should respond 'yes'.  \n- If the error is unrelated (e.g., missing files, syntax errors, crashes), I should respond 'no'.\n\nSince this is a missing file error and not a dimensional mismatch, the correct response is **'no'**.\n\n**Here is my response:**  \nno",

This suggests a missing initial condition or boundary condition file for the temperature field 'T' in the case directory. The error occurs during the file reading process within the global file operations, specifically in the function `uncollatedFileOperation::readStream`.\n\nThe question asks whether this error explicitly indicates a dimensional inequality, such as an imbalance or mismatch in physical dimensions (e.g., length vs. velocity units, or inconsistent dimensions between fields or parameters). The key points are:\n\n- The error is about a missing file, not about incompatible units or dimension mismatches.\n- There are no messages indicating a dimension mismatch, such as \"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] != [1 0 0 0 0 0 0]\" or similar.\n- The error occurs during file I/O, not during calculations that would highlight dimensional inconsistencies.\n- The mention of 'cannot find file' is about file existence, not about data validity or dimension compatibility.\n\nBased on this, the error does not directly reference or indicate a dimensional inequality. It is primarily a file-not-found issue.\n\nHere is my response: no",

The error occurs during the execution of the function `uncollatedFileOperation::readStream`, which suggests that OpenFOAM is attempting to read a field file named \"T\" (commonly representing temperature) from the initial time directory but is unable to locate it.  \n\nThe critical aspect here is whether this error message is explicitly about a dimensional inequality. The message does not mention or suggest any issues with units, dimensions, or mismatch in the physical units or dimensions of variables. Instead, it clearly states that a specific file is missing, which is a filesystem or input data issue rather than a dimensional inconsistency problem.  \n\nIn OpenFOAM, errors involving dimensional inequalities typically mention mismatched units or dimensions explicitly, such as \"[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]\" vs \"[1 0 0 0 0 0 0]\" or similar, indicating a mismatch in physical units or dimensions between fields or boundary conditions. The error message would reference dimension vectors or comparison failures.  \n\nSince this error simply states that the file cannot be found, it is not an indication of a dimensional inequality but rather a missing file. Therefore, the error does not directly reference dimensional inequality.  \n\nHere is my response:  \n**no**",
